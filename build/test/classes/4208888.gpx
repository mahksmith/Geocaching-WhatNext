      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The cache is located near the intersection of SH3 and SH4
south-west of Te Kuiti. Access is via a public walkway across
scenic farmland leading to a historical site up a small hill with
great views in all directions. To get to the start of the track,
turn off SH4 at S38° 25.560' E175° 6.770' and follow Tuhua Road for
about 1 km to S38° 25.563' E175° 6.419'.&lt;/p&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Originally this cache used a small recycled plastic bottle
formerly holding orange juice, but later this was replaced by a
slightly larger 1.25L plastic bottle. The original coordinates were
S38° 25.490' E175° 6.139' and the container was in a small
depression on the sloping ground about 20m SSW of the cross, and
covered by an old plank. But this area was trampled by cattle
around mid 2004 and the original cache appears to have been buried,
or perhaps found and removed by someone. A replacement was put in
place 22 October 2004 at a slightly different position but you
still may want to search for the old container also!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should allow up to one hour from your vehicle for a return
trip at a leisurely pace, although fit young things in a hurry
could probably halve that time. The last part of the walk is quite
steep and probably not suitable for very young children. Wear
sturdy footware with a decent tread, especially in damp conditions.
Watch out for thistles, and (at times) "animal waste". It's about a
100m climb from the start to the top.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">For this cache I suggest that you make it an over night trip and
stay a night in the Pinnicles Hut. Pre book a bed from DOC in
Thames and pay at the HQ in the valley on the way in. The Webb
Creek steps are hard but think of the history of the area. Once you
have dropped your gear at the hut and had a meal walk up the
Pinnicles about 1 and half hour return. Well worth it for the
views. Find the cache in the morning on the way out as it is only
about 500 metres from the hut at the start of the Rangihau track.
Use the power pole with the solar panel o nit as the marker. I
suggest that you return to the car via the Billygoat track. Clear
tuppaware with a red lid. Contains matches, ball, stickers, pack of
cards,pen, pencil, notebook and bar</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>On the Rangihau track near the pinnicles hut.  Stand with your back to the Enviroment Waikato sticker on the power pole.  Walk 14 pacesfollowing the left hand power line to a teetree bush and then look near another teetree bush past the first.  It's under a white board</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The gps co-ordinates are for the car
park.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Situated 25 kms west of Waitomo Village, the
Mangapohue Natural Bridge is a 17metre high limestone arch which
spans the Mangapohue stream. It is all that remains of an ancient
underground river system that has collapsed over time. The
stalactite studded ceiling is evidence of what was once a giant
underground cavern. The 25 minute walk takes you over a trail where
you will see fossils 30 million years old. Glowworms appear at
night, and if you're extra lucky, long tailed bats....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Follow the track in until you come to the
bottom of the main stair case and you will see a display board, on
this board is information about the cave.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your mission is to email me (do not include it
in your log) the background colour on the right hand side of this
board and also include a photo of you holding your gps somewhere
within the cave system (include the photo with your log) for proof
of having visited here.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;Sorry but as of 1st December
2007, no logs will be accepted without photographic proof of your
visit due to a few from around the world who see fit to couch-cache
spoiling it for everyone....&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

mountain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Originally placed with permission and adopted
by Butterfly Lady.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Be prepared for an uphill walk - two tracks, first one is the
challenging one. 2nd is slightly less so, with smaller depth to the
steps.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">To access, go up the gravel road and over the railway crossing (see
map). Follow road to second carved gate.&lt;br /&gt;
Track goes up mountain and is fairly easy to follow, though can be
slippery in places when wet.&lt;br /&gt;
First track starts off through gorse but soon enters regenerating
bush.&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is a blue 2 litre systema container and contains logbook,
stash note and the usual trading goodies.&lt;br /&gt;
Bring a camera - on a fine day the views are breathtaking (and so
is the climb)&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Starting point:  S 37° 48.317 E 175° 18.980 (park here).

This walk includes approx. 750 metres of boardwalk through one of the most significant remnants of native vegetation in Hamilton- including swamp maire.  The walk meanders among the bush and trees along the river bank, including some areas where you are in the bush canopy itself.

Contour is flat to rolling and the surface is boardwalk grass and sand.  There are a few concrete steps and pavers.

Allow about 1 hour for the walk, including the worthwhile extra few minutes to the far end of the boardwalk (makes round trip 2.1km).
This cache was repositioned after it was bulldozed over by workmen. The co-ordinates have been adjusted.

Little known old Pa site just off River Rd.
Parking may be difficult as its a narrow and busy rd.
Follow the GPS-you shouild find some steps that take you down towards the water.GPS readings can be a bit dodgy near GZ. EPE of about 8mtrs.
Cache is a Oranged lidded Jimboz container.
Note the Pa fortifications and the notice board which gives you both the Maori and European history of the area.
The Pa belonged to Ngati Hanui a sub tribe of the Ngati Wairere, and was the last to be occupied untill it was abandoned in 1864.

This location should be safe from the vagaries of the river</groundspeak:long_description>

this cache is NOT recommend for children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">New Zealand's favourite bird has five species - Great Spotted (roa), Little spotted, Northern Brown, Rowi And Tokoeka (Haast Tokoeka &amp; Southern Tokoeka).
The kiwi is a nocturnal creature, has no tail, and is covered with a hair-like loosely attached feathers giving it a shaggy appearance.  It differs from other birds in that its nostrils are at the tip of the bill instead of the base, and it has a well developed sense of smell.  
After finding this cache, head across the road and find out more about the kiwi, and if you time it right (9am to 4.30pm any day except Christmas Day) you will be able to view the kiwi.  Alternatively head along from the cache to the open area and visit the Rotary park aviaries for free.

There is not good GPS coverage under the trees, so please do use the hint.

After parking your vehicle / bike or making your way on foot, find the little bridge, which will take you into a lovely grove of trees. Remember kiwis prefer a dark spot.

THIS IS A KIWI THEME CACHE.  Where possible swap a kiwi trinket or similar souvenir please.  A 2 litre sistema box, painted black / green.  Please hide well afterwards :)

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A GREAT example of park and garden staff endorsing geocaching.&lt;br /&gt;
The hide has been built for the cache!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A garden that has all the best!&lt;br /&gt;
And just take a peek through the gate&lt;br /&gt;
at just the right season&lt;br /&gt;
and the largest pumpkins you might spy!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/3bf1cd48-15dd-44b8-8d4c-d930574364ac.jpg" width="80" height="80" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This cache has been set up with our younger cachers in mind&lt;br /&gt;
Wander the gardens and you might find&lt;br /&gt;
a worm farm nearby,&lt;br /&gt;
a chicken tractor&lt;br /&gt;
and fruit and vegetables galore.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A word of caution though&lt;br /&gt;
the gates you might find shut&lt;br /&gt;
if in winter you decide to visit after 5.00pm&lt;br /&gt;
Or during daylight savings time later than 7pm&lt;br /&gt;
So no staying up past bedtime just for this one&lt;br /&gt;
No excuses for a late night!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
UPDATE - Jan 09 - time change for daylight savings closure time..... now 7pm&lt;br /&gt;
Check out the new armchair.&lt;br /&gt;
Hint should be used, as this is a high muggle area at times&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/83abb7fb-595d-40b5-a10a-08c7e977d49a.jpg" width="214" height="52" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Tahoma" color="#6666FF"&gt;The cache location is now best approached via the sundial area. New fencing has appeared and all the gardens in this area require you to enter via the sundial court area.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a click clack container with goodies suitable for the younger set. This is a quieter spot of the gardens, but you still need to be wary as people are often admiring the produce, and workers come and go.&lt;br /&gt;
Do check out the tamarillos, squash and salad vegetables. There was peanuts growing recently too!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And the new Te Para gardens take you back in time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please ensure this is out of sight when replacing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One more note - follow the link and you can download a map before you head out to this cache. Or pick one up at the information centre as you head in.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Update - July 2009 - Windows in the hedge mean muggles may observe you at GZ - keep a watch out for them!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Logging Etiquette:&lt;/b&gt; Geocache hiders sometimes go through a great deal of planning to place their caches. As a result, they'd like to hear your feedback on whether you liked or disliked any aspect of the hide, or if you feel that some cache maintenance is required.&lt;br /&gt;
Single word, acronym, or emoticon logs may be easier when you have a lot of caches to log, but it doesn't tell the hider or other finders anything about your adventure (or lack thereof) in finding the cache. Please keep this in mind when entering your log.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Logging Etiquette:&lt;/b&gt; Geocache hiders sometimes go through a great deal of planning to place their caches. As a result, they'd like to hear your feedback on whether you liked or disliked any aspect of the hide, or if you feel that some cache maintenance is required.&lt;br /&gt;
Single word, acronym, or emoticon logs may be easier when you have a lot of caches to log, but it doesn't tell the hider or other finders anything about your adventure (or lack thereof) in finding the cache. Please keep this in mind when entering your log.&lt;br /&gt;

The Kids will love this one.
It is very close to the Frankton rail yard and the rear of the Waikato Racing Club. You can see the big engines beside the little ones!!
Open days sees a variety of Mini train engines hosted by the Hamilton Model Railway Engineers Incorporated. See picture for Open Day dates, when train rides are $1 each and go right around the track complex.
There is a sign  "Do Not Cross the Tracks" while the trains are running.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Mangere Mountain is a volcano, a hilltop park; situated on the shores of the Manukau Harbour. The mountain has a turbulent and rich history — volcanic and human. The nature of its 'birth' and the sequence of eruptions can be deciphered from the remaining cone, craters and firepits. There are also many marks on the mountain made by humans. Maori made terraces, pits and tips are visual reminders of their long occupation of the mountain.   The website www.mangeremountain.co.nz is really worth a visit, and cachers could consider doing the Landmarker Walk.

The cache contains the usual assortment of items plus a logbook.</groundspeak:long_description>

primeval gorge towering above you.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;By day it is an easy paddle for beginners of between five
hundred and fifteen hundred meters or so depending on your start
point and you will get to see the moss and fern covered walls while
gliding along listening to the dripping water. But for the REAL
adventure, and to experience a fantastic glow worm display, you
will have to do this trip at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ONLY way to get to this cache is from the lake via some kind
of water craft so the terrain rating is 5 (special equipment) as
per the guidelines. A land-based assault is NOT POSSIBLE so please
don&amp;rsquo;t even try it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have your own kayak they can be rented on a
casual basis from a place not too far up the road (send me a
message if you want to know where to go). There are also commercial
kayak trips to the cache site so don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if you
run into others paddling along in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is a camo painted 1.2 litre Sistema container.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Once you get to the waypoint you need to find 2 similar looking

other contains a 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final cache is located at: S37. 47.ABC, E175 33.DEF,
where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC = 947 minus the number containing the 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEF = 566 minus the number containing the 9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is hidden in a large camo painted ammo box containing
trade items, cache notes, logbook and pen. Please take care to
avoid disturbing the natural cover too much when hunting for this

&lt;br /&gt;
A business person cache, located in Hamilton Central. High muggle
element at all times, due to public area, nearby casino, business,
commerical environment etc....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A high degree of stealth required.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nano sized cache..... black, and very small. Smaller than the tip
of Butterfly Lady's smallest finger - and she has teensy weensy
hands!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The co-ords will take you to a spot to rest. Remember NANO and
BLACK - this may aid your hunt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
GOOD LUCK!&lt;br /&gt;
BRING YOUR OWN PEN OR PENCIL.&lt;br /&gt;
But, even more alarming / challenging, will be the requirement to
sign the log, and then get it back into the cache. Be very careful.
Ripping the log will incur the wrath of the cachers that
follow.&lt;br /&gt;
BRING YOUR OWN PEN OR PENCIL.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, did I say ..... &lt;font size="5" face="Tahoma" color=
"#CC0099"&gt;BRING YOUR OWN PEN OR PENCIL!!!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Good luck.

Single word, acronym, or emoticon logs may be easier when you have a lot of caches to log, but it doesn't tell the hider or other finders anything about your adventure (or lack thereof) in finding the cache. Please keep this in mind when entering your log.&lt;br /&gt;

Hayes Paddock has been in the news here in Hamilton over the past few years because developers are wanting to redevelop the area by removing old State houses and building flash new houses.
"A little corner of Hamilton has turned into a battleground between the forces of development and the forces of preservation."
But this favourite example of 1930s art of the state in providing good housing has become a battlefield where heritage defends its lines against the forces of development. Concern over the future of Hayes Paddock, named after Irishman Patrick Hayes, who once farmed it, has stirred passions to the point where the police were called to Jellicoe Drive last October when residents tried to block a house transporter with their cars. Thirty residents made their protest at a gaping hole opening up in the fabric of the neighbourhood. Three former state homes were removed. A consent for the removal of six more was granted at the time of writing.A subdivision that created five lots from clearances met zone density rules and has resource consent for an apartment block. The zone allows one unit per 400 square metres.
Its 1930s socialist planners wanted Hayes Paddock to be a garden suburb and its single dwellings were built on sections of about 612 to 700 square metres. Here was room for a shed and a vegetable garden and a lawn for children to play on. Different but matching homes - singles, duplexes and two-storey units - were positioned for the sun above curving tree-lined streets and around secluded cul-de-sacs.

The heritage value of Hayes Paddock was also outlined in a 1997 heritage survey by Dinah Holman, of Auckland. Later,Hayes Paddock was included as a heritage protection area, similar to the Frankton Railway Village precinct, in Hamilton City's 1999 draft district plan.
The above was quoted from " State Houses &amp; Proud of them" Winter 2003; A NZ Historic Places Trust document.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very special reserve.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This beautiful bush reserve on the lower slopes of Mount Piriongia
is full of wonderful mature trees. The native undergrowth is thick,
and the canopy is mostly dense. Part of a historic Maori trail to
Kawhia passes through a corner of the reserve.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Walter Scott Reserve was donated to the Royal Forest and Bird
Society by sisters, Molly and Lillian Valder, who requested that it
be named after their neighbour, who enjoyed bush walking. From
Piriongia, head south towards Kawhia, taking Ngutunui Road. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Turn into Pekanui Road, then turning again into Scott Road (where
there are 5 letterboxes). Parking is available at the entrance to
the walking track.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 PLEASE FOLLOW THE TRACKS AT ALL TIMES. This is native reserve, and
care should be taken to stay to the tracks, and not damage the
sensitive regenerating plant life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Of interest, there is much moss, fungi and other smaller plants on
the track and at the edge. To access the cache, you will need only
to take ONE step off the track. Usual rule applies - leave nothing
in the bush but footprints, take nothing of the bush, but photos.
On entering the bush, you have the option of a longer walk
(1.5hours), a short loop (30mins) or direct to the cache (20 mins
return). &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 If you do not wish to enjoy the walkway, but just find the cache,
then take the right fork where the path divides. Shortly after
passing the rimu grove, you will arrive at a spot where there is a
great view of the mountains to the south.&lt;br&gt;

     width="500" height="322"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
From here take the new bypass route (due to a fallen tree) and the
cache is just a few minutes on. Of special note near the cache site
is the growth on the vines. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Cache is a small amno can.&lt;br&gt;

Part of the Te Araroa Walkway
In 2005 Te Araroa Waikato Trust laid in a route from Till's lookout on the edge of Hamilton's western Dinsdale suburb, to Taitua Arboretum, an attractive 20-hectare reserve of mature trees, lakes, pasture and trails 

The Te Araroa track was marked and stiled over fences, but not signposted as it is just the first part of a longer 'City to Mountain' track connecting Hamilton to Pirongia mountain, and not yet complete. You can see the styles and 1st set of markers not far from the stumps and the fence line towards Pirongia.

Hamilton City has now swung in behind this first section however. The city's draft Long Term Community Plan, proposes a $279,000 budget in the 2006-2007 year to upgrade the 3 kilometres of track Till's Lookout to Taitua Arboretum to daywalk standard.

At the track's beginning at Dinsdale, the council proposes to lay in a concrete path between Amanda Avenue and Melva Street. It will then metal the track from Till's Lookout to Wallace Road, provide a safe footpath along that rural road, further metal the track from Wallace Road across farmland to the arboretum, and then install signage for the whole route.

Tills lookout is 4.2 hectares.

&lt;p&gt;The hall originally occupied a site on the nearby corner of Moa and Kea streets, and was relocated in 1989, being saved by protesters holding a dawn vigil, after demolition had actually started. It is currently owned by the City Council, and used by many community groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hall’s design was heavily influenced by the California Bungalow style in keeping with the railway houses in Frankton. When traveling to and from the cache, look at the streets of similar protected railway houses in this special suburb. The hall was designed by the famous Sir George Troup, architect of many railway stations from humble stopping places to the grand Dunedin station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Railway Hall is build of heart rimu and matai, and includes an upstairs caretakers flat, used until 1989.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adjacent sports club generates much muggle foot traffic, so please take care when picking up and returning the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a 200ml sistema box, painted camo, and contains a log book and small exchange tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="background:yellow;"&gt;Please Please - Don't put the box back on the ground - it goes under water in a big puddle when it rains.. put in back on the beam under the ramp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">In an era of hand-operated fuel pumps with large looking-glasses outside motor repair garages or small basic tin shacks, this was one of the first purpose-build petrol stations, with modern electric pump bowsers, in New Zealand.  The business was named after the shape of the section, squeezed into the space available

The building is well hidden by the alternations to Massey St in 1985, but is still in use as part of an adjacent workshop, and has been restored externally to remind us of an earlier era in this industry.  This cache provides an opportunity to stop and note a site that many would miss as they pass by.

After loosing the first box, the cache is now  a camo tube, containing a log and pencil only.  There is no room for exchange tokens only.  Pleas re-hide it well and cover with leaves again.

A sandwich bar has opened in the building in early 2011, which sees customers calling again - but will make your hint a little more difficult.

The area is saturated with muggles on a working day, so night-time or weekends are the only time to search here.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The Frankton Railway House Factory is a unique building, with the distinctive “sawtooth” shaped roof, of all-wooden construction.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">An innovative housing scheme was introduced in 1919 to accommodate railway workers, many of whom were returned servicemen.  Rail was booming, and famous Railways Architect Sir George Troup developed a scheme to rapidly deploy new homes by pre-fabricating them.  Frankton, a very busy railway junction and repair workshops, was chosen as the site for the factory and production began in 1921.

The railway house factory was well planned, and efficiently laid out.  Native timber, mainly heart rimu, tawa and matai, was brought in to the site by rail to the factory siding where the adjacent sawmill cut and stacked the timber.  The dried lengths were then cut and assembled into individually numbered parts, and the completed kits then railed out again to railway towns or small clusters of houses in quiet country districts. Major suburbs of these mass-produced houses are still present in Frankton, and Moera, Lower Hutt.  Go for a drive to nearby cache GCYBQ8, and look at the rows of the factory product, in this protected suburb.

The factory produced one and a half houses per day, and it took three men 2 weeks to erect one house.  Between 1923 and 1926 increased efficiencies saw production rise to 500 houses per year and the cost of a five-room house fall from £831 to £635. Ironically, this success led to the scheme's downfall. Timber companies threatened by state competition scuttled the scheme by convincing the government that private enterprise could build workers' houses more cheaply.

The factory was closed in 1929, and the building was absorbed into the railways industrial complex.  In the early 1990’s it was deteriorating, and in use by a variety of small industrial businesses.  After input by historic places trust, the current owner has fully renovated the building and it is tenanted with a range of commercial businesses.

We therefore continue to be able to enjoy this one-of-a-kind building, reminding us of what was the first kitset house factory in New Zealand.

The area is busy with muggles coming and going during the day, including Saturdays, so this is a night or Sunday cache.

You are looking for a 200ml sistema box, painted black.  It contains a logbook, and range of small trades.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The Lodge was built in 1874 for the Loyal Hamilton Lodge of the Independent Order of Oddfellows, by local carpenter, Edward Pearson, who was originally with the 4th Waikato Militia Regiment.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">When Pearson became unable to continue as a carpenter, he looked for business opportunities, and eventually settled on soap-making.  In 1886 he bought the Lodge, and established a soap factory producing the famous Pearson’s Carbolic Sand Soap.

The soap factory closed in 1896 after Pearson’s death, the building was used for social functions, and for a time as a picture theatre.  In 1955 it was bought by Berlei and became a corset factory, then was used for storage by a flooring company.

In 1967 the Buffalo Lodge bought the property, so it reverted to its original use, and was used this way for more than 30 years.  In 2001 the building changed hands again and after major renovation, very sympathetic to the original design, it opened as a Café and Bar.

We now enjoy this elder statesman of Hamilton’s buildings, with its great views over Steele Park, (formally Sydney Square), a popular cricket and games ground. The high density of sporting muggles and patrons of the premises means great stealth is needed, and probably mornings or early afternoons are best for your hunt. 

The cache is a 200ml sistema box, painted camo, and contains a log book and small exchange tokens.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Born in the extensive and diverse Price engineering works in Thames, this machine served the owners of the massive Kinleith complex for many years, hauling logs and timber products.

It now sits proudly, although slowly decaying away, in front of much interesting machinery.

Many have commented on the "unlikely" colours - however this is how 218 spent his later years- in the company colours of NZ Forrest Products - it certainly stood out well!

After the 400ml box was destroyed twice by muggles, I have had to reduce it to a magnetic keyholder. Too many little muggles crawling all over this beast to hide a box me thinks.

After you have the cache, have a look around this old sawmill site, with its extensive historical displays.

NOTE: while this is definitely a fun spot for the kids to see some machinery on display, State Highway 1 is only a few meters away, with no fence, so keep them close.

There is good off-road parking adjacent to the spot.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Two (2) stages plus final cache, that will encourage you to use your powers of observation.


1st waypoint is a micro, with the co-ords for the 2nd waypoint.  
It belongs, but is out of place... do you see it?  
Please replace so as to belong.  
This is the hardest of the 3 to find.  Tree coverage makes accuracy difficult.  
Look around - you DO NOT need to step off the track here - it is a boardwalk, after all!


2nd waypoint will require you to look closely, and holds the co-ords for final cache.  
Again accuracy is a little marginal, but look around - sometimes the obvious is overlooked.  
Can you see it...  hint here - note what you see - it may help you with the final cache.    

Final cache is well, yours to discover!  
Use your powers of observation - no hints or clues!
Look around - you may need to take ONE step off the track.

Cache is small - about 400ml, concealed.  Not much room for travel bugs, but geocoins should fit well.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">At the published waypoint is a very informative sign about John Rochfort, the engineer who explored for and laid out the Main Trunk Railway between Marton and Te Awamutu.

Read the sign and glean some information for the final cache location.  Look up and across the main road to sight the "Star Hotel" mentioned on the sign.

A = the sum of the digits of the year in which John Rochfort died.

B = the last digit of the year in which John Rochfort was born.   ie.  183B

C = The year in which John Rochfort was made redunant, minus 1406

D = The number of passengers who boarded the train on 7th August.

E = The speed over temporary rails, plus 170.



Using this information, proceed to the following location.

S  38   B . C
E  175  A . (D+E)
Here you will find the final resting place for John Rochfort, the Railway Man, less than 2km away.
To find the cache, head south (Magnetic) 13 metres, from the resting place.  

Cache is small - 200ml sistema.
This wee town is known for caches to go missing, hence the need to ensure it is hidden well again.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;font size="3"&gt;2. Go to the listed coordinates to find a micro
cache slightly smaller than an AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;
 The micro cache contains a key - note it down&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;font size="3"&gt;3. Using the solved crossword and the key from the
micro you can decypher these two locations&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Note regarding access point&lt;/u&gt; Go through the
righthand gate of two adjacent farm gates. You must be on the
right-hand side of the tall deer fence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This walkway is the start of the proposed council project to
provide access / walkway all the way through to Newstead
Cemetery....its on their 5-year plan....hence it is yet to be
completed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 UPDATE - The walkway has been completed and you can travel all the
way through to the Morrisville road (Newstead Cemetery). Lovely
Walk on a sunny day!&lt;/font&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This walk takes you to the site of Motakiora Pa, built in the 17th Century and occupied by Rora a son of the Great Maori Chief Maniapoto.
Rora was slain by his wifes people after he killed her lover. Maniapoto sought retribution but eventually called a halt to the violence, and peace was declared between the 2 people.

This land was once owned by Colin Brook who at the time used very innovative farming practices. He did most of the plantings and built a number of flood protection dams on the property.

There are three tracks in this park-blue, red and yellow.
They vary in time between 30 mins and 90 mins in length.

The red track is the longest circuit, takes you up to the yellow track which takes you round the old pa site at the top.

There are beutiful views at the top and its well worth the effort to get there.
Cache container is a Clear 1 Litre Sistema container.
Originally it had Pistol Pete Laser TB on his 1st mission.
Note this is slightly offset-the clue will help.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Puzzles around here are too easy, so it is time to raise the bar
a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t have a cache that needs a special tool here yet
either, so this cache is a test for the puzzle-solving, tool
carrying caching geek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2003 some learned people published document uvw.xyg. You
need to find what this document number is, and use the tool it
describes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After your research, solve this simple puzzle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K = u ÷ 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L = u + x&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M = u&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N = u &amp;ndash; w&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O = v + y&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P = y&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q = u - y&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R = w + x + y + x&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S = w + y + x&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T = y- x&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to 37 KL.MNO, 175 PQ.RST, then use the tool to discover the
final co-ordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a metal amo can, with themed swaps. Feel
free to swap for a non-themed item, or take something anyhow - I
will keep the items updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="background:yellow"&gt;Please ensure you re-hide the
box well with leaves and sticks. This is a large-ish box for the
location, and does not get a lot of visitors, so we need to be
carefull to ensure it is not seen by muggles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="background:yellow"&gt;I know there are lots of
prickles at GZ &amp;ndash; they keep the kiddie muggles away &amp;ndash; be
careful when you grab the needed leaf litter!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It commemorates the role of the pioneers of Hydro Electrical Generation in New Zealand, and their achievements in developing the hydro potential of the Waikato River.

6,000,000,000 Kilo Watt hours of electrictry was generated from this turbine runner between 1929 and 1991.  
It turned at the speed of 214 RPM.

Please respect the environment here, and do not step onto the garden.  You will not find the cache there. 

BYO pen or pencil.  This is a log only cache.  No room for a pencil without compromising the cache.

Be wary of a high muggle population during business hours!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please be careful opening and closing this cache. It requires correct alignment. The VERY SMALL log is in the lower part and may fall out if you are not vigilant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not recommended at night - Dracula might be lurking!!&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;font size="4" face="Arial"&gt;Soil from Transylvania's blighted earth which will help Count Dracula regain his strength has been found below this cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font size="5" face="Tahoma" color="#990000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approach with caution!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/712269fb-ac93-4e46-af65-ff1c47df6e39.jpg" width="457" height="336" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He awaits his next victim.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;You&lt;/b&gt; do not wish to have the same fate as the captain of the Russian ship, the Demeter. His body was found tied to the helm, and the ship's log revealed strange events that had taken place during the ship's journey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nor do you wish to be courted by this Count, like Lucy Westerna in London. Visiting her bed chamber each night the count slowly drained her life force, whilst simultaneously infecting her with the curse of Vampirism. Despite attempts by others to keep him at bay with garlic, he eventually fatally drained her body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dr Van Helsing, the former mentor of one of Lucy's suitors and Jonathan Harker, a newly qualified English solicitor, entered Lucy's crypt and slained her reanimated corpse, then proceeded to enter Dracula's residence at Carfax Abbey, destroyed his boxes of earth, thus depriving the Count of his ability to refuel his powers. Dracula left England and returned to his homeland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eventually, the group of heroes tracked the Count back to his Transylvanian homeland, and after a vicious battle with Dracula's gypsy bodyguards, destroyed him.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;font size="5" face="Tahoma" color="#990000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Or so they think......&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Your mission now is to locate Dracula's Drop, leave your mark if you dare......&lt;br /&gt;
Beware his companions nearby who are after YOUR blood!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The more marks collected on the log, the less likely Count Dracula is to return.&lt;br /&gt;
Your log mark counts......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Logging Etiquette:&lt;/b&gt; Geocache hiders sometimes go through a great deal of planning to place their caches. As a result, they'd like to hear your feedback on whether you liked or disliked any aspect of the hide, or if you feel that some cache maintenance is required.&lt;br /&gt;
Single word, acronym, or emoticon logs may be easier when you have a lot of caches to log, but it doesn't tell the hider or other finders anything about your adventure (or lack thereof) in finding the cache. Please keep this in mind when entering your log.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is located in the Te Tapui Reserve. This area incorporates two volcanic peaks of age 5.6 million years old. The two peaks are Te Tapui and Maungakawa.
The literature says this is a Moderate grade tramp. of about 2 hrs 30 min return.
Its quite hard to find the reserve but well worth it.
the bush is beautiful and the view from the summit of Maungakawa (496m) west towards Cambridge and east towards the Kaimai Ranges.
The doc have this listed on there web site : http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/trackandwalk.aspx?id=35871

Note:
This is not the actual Te Tapui walk as we now know. Its 2 km further up the rd.
I went up the hill and found an open area with reasonable GPS fix. Placed the cache. I wondered further up the hill looking for more markers and then got somewhat lost and had a devil of a job to find my way back.
The bush looks the same and I got quite disorientated.
Warning-mark your entry point in this area.
people with the newer GPS units with the Sirf 111 chips should be ok. The difficulty relates to the difficult GPS fix.!!

Cache is a clear coloured systema container about 300 ml with log sheet and a few items.</groundspeak:long_description>

Note: A local farmer may have animals grazing so leave all gates as you find them.
The cache is hidden along the Araheke Trail.It's a blue plastic container with a black lid,concealed by a large rock. (You'll know it when you see it). 
The coordinates were showing as up to 10 m away when right next to the cache. However when approaching and reading the GPSr there is no doubt where it should be.
It is possible the rock is from an eruption from the nearby Mt Egmont/Mt Taranaki. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Taranaki/Egmont</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Situated within the junction of Ranolf Street and Lake Road, Kuirau
Park is a popular inner-city reserve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kuirau Park occupies an area of geothermal activity typified by
many hot springs, gas and steam upflows, thermally altered ground
and silica deposits from prehistoric times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Much of the southern part of the reserve was developed during the
Depression of the 1930's. Until then it was almost entirely swamp
but covered with a heavy growth of manuka. The northern part of the
reserve wasn't developed until later and still contains many
geothermal features.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kuirau Park is part of the Rotorua Walkway and, as in all
geothermal areas, you are advised to stay on the walkway for your
safety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Geothermal activity occurs where hot water rises to the
earth&amp;rsquo;s surface. The bubbling water or steam we see are just
the tip of a column or tongue of hot water that may extend for
hundreds or thousands of metres below the ground. This is known as
a geothermal system.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To log this EarthCache, you must do the following and email us the
results. &lt;b&gt;You can go ahead and log your find, (ie. you don't need
to wait for permission)&lt;/b&gt; but if we don&amp;rsquo;t think you have
honestly completed the required tasks we will delete your log
(after emailing you first of course):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;1)Email me the first, seventh and last word on the sign at
GZ&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2)Have a walk around the area, and email me how many active hot
water pools there are in a 75 meter radius&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3)Take a photo of yourself with gps near one of the hot
pools.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please email me this info, please DO NOT post it with your log.
&lt;u&gt;Just post your photo.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Situated along the new Waikari Loop Track. Parking is available
at the end of Kutai Street at the beginning of the walking track
which follows the Tongariro River and returns through the native
Manuka bush to the start. The cache is placed beside the track for
an easy find, only a couple of steps off to the side. Altitude
404m. BE CAREFUL not to destroy plants as you search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some stealth is required, keep an eye open as you search, the
track is also used by trout fishermen and they sneak quietly along
the track in their waders!!! You may be lucky enough to see rafters
floating past on the river rapids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please cover the cache well and rearrange the greenery with
care.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Situated along the new Waikari Loop Track. Parking is available
at the end of Kutai Street at the beginning of the walking track
which follows the river and returns through the native bush to the
start. The track passes the old Pumice Quarry, known locally as the
Pumice Pit. These days the pit is used as a playground for mountain
bikes and trail bikes. You may hear them in the distance as you
approach, they are in a separate area and not on the walking track.
A very short disguised track through the bush will take you to the
cliff edge that overlooks the pit and you may be lucky enough to
see the riders in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is hidden near the bike track. Altitude 430m. There is
a signpost at the bike track junction. For safety, do not venture
along this track. Keep on the walking track loop. You can choose to
walk the full loop, an easy walk, or return the way you came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please rehide the cache carefully so it cannot be seen.
Arrange the greenery with care.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Bring your togs!!

You won't need them to find the cache but this is the most fabulous hot spring I have ever seen, a stream of hot water with a waterfall and bathing pool! 

WARNING - As with all natural hot springs don't put your head under the water! 

I still can't believe how beautiful this place is.

There is no signpost for Kerosene Creek from the main road, so watch your GPS. It's not a secret and the footpaths are maintained, but it is a gravel (metalled) road for about 2km before the car park.

You do have to cross the stream to get to the cache but it is at a narrow point that the average person will be able to step accross without getting wet.

 The Cobham Bridge is close to the Hamilton Gardens and a number of
river beaches that are busy during summer. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is part of the route of State Highway 1 through Hamilton. The
bridge serves as a landmark in several 'round the bridges' events
in the city. The circuit from Cobham Bridge to the city, across the
Victoria Bridge and back to Cobham is a pleasant 5 km walk. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A problem arose with the building of the Cobham Bridge; SH1 was to
run through some reserve land. The Mayor contacted the Minister of
Works, who came up from Wellington and ordered the road be re-sited
to allow the development of the Hamilton Gardens. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
There is no need to go off the path. This is a traditional cache,
but we found GPS coverage a bit difficult at this spot, so we have
provided two clues. You need to do a little work for the second one
and answer these questions.. &lt;br /&gt;
1. What year was the Cobham Bridge opened? &lt;br /&gt;
2. What does the sum of the digits of that year - 8 equal? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Parking is available in nearby streets, or at the gardens. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Park at S37 59.636  E175 34.719  Walk up accessway across farm paddocks until the reserve predator proof fence is reached. Enter through the right hand gates leading to "Old mountain/Summit Track". The route follows the fenceline maintenance road for 20 minutes before a clearly marked turn onto the track proper. This climbs steadily and steeply in parts for about 1hr 30 min. to an intersection near the summit. Follow the track sign to the summit trig which is only a level 10 minutes further on.

This expedition can be extended slightly by returning to the track intersection and taking the right hand option for about 30 min to the "Hook Nose" cache which has good views north. Return the same way to your vehicle. 
Alternatively, if you can arrange another vehicle at Tari Road end, Pukeatua, a full mountain crossing can be done by continuing on past the trig (about 6 hours total) which will enable you to take in views to the South/West while locating "Pukeatua Peak" cache on the way. 

Expect muddy shoes once going beyond the trig and at all times look for and follow orange triangle markers. (There are various predator monitoring tracks passed which use Pink or Yellow markers which should be ignored).</groundspeak:long_description>

An opportunity to explore the University of Waikato campus,
capering optional.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=
'font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The above coordinates are just the general area, and a good
place to park.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=
'font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'&gt;
The &lt;a href="http://www.waikato.ac.nz/"&gt;University &lt;span class=
"GramE"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; Waikato&lt;/a&gt; was officially opened in 1964 by then
Governor-General, Sir Bernard Fergusson.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=
'font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'&gt;
Today the university is home to 13,500 students and has continued
to be a breeding ground for independent thought and progressive
learning. In 1989 (with a little help from NASA) we connected New
Zealand to the Internet before going on to become the first
University in New Zealand to have cyber-graduates, completing their
teaching degrees online.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=
'font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'&gt;
The campus now covers some 68 hectares and is a far cry from its
modest beginnings in 1964 on what was largely farmland, with a
handful of temporary buildings and a few staff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=
'font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'&gt;
This cache requires you to explore a number of areas of the campus
to find the following items.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=

These will guide you to a general area where you can find a small
micro containing coordinates for the final cache. Obviously, campus
can be busy with plenty of muggles around. You may need to reach /
step into a garden for the final, but there is no need to bush bash
or wander off paths.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=
'font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'&gt;
The final is a 200ml Sistema, room for small swaps only.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=
'font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'&gt;

Waikato of a hundred taniwha&lt;br /&gt;
At every bend a taniwha can be found.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/b4107960-a9ec-4f83-8f3e-7099d09d9621.jpg" width="100" height="139" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Waikato River is New Zealand’s longest. Its headwaters arise on Mt Ruapehu, just south of Turangi, and merge with Lake Taupo via the Waikato Stream. At times the Waikato &lt;b&gt;current&lt;/b&gt; can be seen making its way through the water of the lake. The river proper begins at an outlet from the lake near the town of Taupo. It &lt;b&gt;flows&lt;/b&gt; through the northern Taupo region into Waikato, and through the city of Hamilton, before reaching the sea at Port Waikato.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A creature of many forms.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Taniwha are supernatural creatures whose forms and characteristics vary according to different tribal traditions. Though supernatural, in the Maori world view they were seen as &lt;b&gt;part of the natural environment.&lt;/b&gt; Taniwha have been described as fabulous monsters that &lt;b&gt;live in deep water.&lt;/b&gt; Others refer to them as dragons – many taniwha looked like reptiles, had wings and ate people. They could also take the shape of animals such as sharks, whales, octopuses; the Maori name for the Great white shark is Mango-taniwha.&lt;br /&gt;
Some taniwha could change their shape, moving between different forms.&lt;br /&gt;
Taniwha were either male or female. They usually &lt;b&gt;lived in or near the water&lt;/b&gt; – lakes, rivers or the sea. They hid in lairs known as rua taniwha, which could be deep pools, caves, or dangerous waterways – areas that people avoided. In some traditions, taniwha were terrifying creatures that captured people and ate them. In rivers they tend to look more like a gecko or a tuatara, having a row of spines along the back, or a log that acts strangely, such as moving against the current.&lt;br /&gt;
Occasionally, it was said that they would kidnap women to live with them as wives. These monsters would inevitably be killed and the women returned to their families.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Others were kaitiaki, or protectors of iwi (tribes) and hapu (sub-tribes). These ones were respected, and people who passed by their dens would say the appropriate karakia (charm) and leave an offering, often a green twig..&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is placed where you can view the Mighty Waikato.&lt;br /&gt;
Log only cache, bring a pen. Log your name and date only.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;To access the cache and log it you will need to call upon the resources of the Waikato. The log will be checked regularly, and those not leaving a physical log entry, may find their online log deleted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background:yellow;"&gt;NO physical force is required to access the cache. PLEASE DO NOT TUG at anything, or you will compromise the cache!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will require something to retrieve the cache - maybe a tool, maybe an object. What is it? Read the cache description carefully and it will reveal itself.&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
An acknowledgement to KiwiNomad for the inspiration for this and the permission to base a cache on one of his great cache hides.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Logging Etiquette:&lt;/b&gt; Geocache hiders sometimes go through a great deal of planning to place their caches. As a result, they'd like to hear your feedback on whether you liked or disliked any aspect of the hide, or if you feel that some cache maintenance is required.&lt;br /&gt;
Single word, acronym, or emoticon logs may be easier when you have a lot of caches to log, but it doesn't tell the hider or other finders anything about your adventure (or lack thereof) in finding the cache. Please keep this in mind when entering your log.&lt;br /&gt;
</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>[A tool is required!  Most cachers will carry this with them - Check cache name, and use the resources of the Mighty Waikato.  Call the taniwha.  Must levitate (rise) to reveal the cache.  No brute force PLEASE!]</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A cache suitable for the everyday average cacher (no extreme athletes required for this one). A very easy walk through a well maintained 'bush' area along a clearly marked and well maintained track. Unless there has been very heavy recent rain there should be no need to get wet or muddy.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">An arboretum is quite simply a collection of trees. Related collections include a fruticetum (from the Latin frutex, meaning shrub), and a viticetum, a collection of vines. More commonly today, an arboretum is known as a botanical garden.
The Taitua Arboretum covers 20 hectares of trees and open pasture with 2.3 kilometres of easy grade walkways.
In 1997 the Taitua Arboretum was gifted to the Hamilton City Council by John and Bunny Mortimer to ensure its sound management and continued development for the benefit of the community.
The Mortimers began planting trees at Taitua in 1973.
Today there are more than 1500 species of idigenous and exotic trees and shrubs.
The overall collection of trees provides a mix of open and wooded areas and contains unusual and rare species of trees and shrubs growing in a variety of soil types and terrains.
The Hamilton City Council continues the vision of the Mortimers and is continuing in developing the Arboretum as a recreational and educational assett for the inspiration and enjoyment of the community.

The co-ordinates listed above take you to the car-park at the start of the Arboretum track... [B]THEY ARE NOT THE FINAL CACHE LOCATION.[/B]

The arboretum is open from 8 am until a 1/2 hour before sunset.
There are lockable gates on the car-park area, so please dont get trapped in here overnight 

From the car-park you will need to go to 4 other waypoints (all within the Arboretum) to gather the required information in order to calculate the final cache location.

[B]Waypoint 1.[/B]

A rock formation at:
S 37 48.307  E 175 12.737

There are (F) rocks that complete this formation.

[B]Waypoint 2.[/B]

A track sign located at:
S 37 48.334  E 175 12.904

The sign advises that the Farm Forestry Track is (D) minutes long,
The sign advises (E) minutes to toilets &amp; carpark.

[B]Waypoint 3.[/B]

A sitting/rest area at:
S 37 48.456  E 175 12.972

There are (C) fixed seats at this location.

[B]Waypoint 4.[/B]

A track sign located at:
S 37 48.371  E 175 12.886

The sign advises (A) minutes to the toilets &amp; carpark,
The sign advises (B) minutes to the start of the Farm Forestry Track.

[B]FINAL CACHE LOCATION: [/B]

A 1 litre clear systema inside a camo TFM bag will be located at:
S 37 48.(ANSWER)   E 175 12.(SOLUTION)

Where (ANSWER) = (192 x B) + A + C
&amp;
Where (SOLUTION) = 614 + (D x (E - F))

The entire track does not take anywhere near the time that the information boards advise that it does (1 &amp; 1/2 hours), so take your time and enjoy the area.

FTF honours go to Psychrn (17.02.2008 @ 0740 hrs).</groundspeak:long_description>

22 DECEMBER 2009 NOTE
Due to the large number of nesting pukekos who seem to get very aggressive when you approach GZ I have made a compromise. Across the road from the cache there is a park with a new sculpture. If you contact me with the name of the Sculptor I will email you the co-ordinates that are in the actual cache. (The co-ords for Heart and Soul of Rotorua) You can stiil try for the cache if you really want but for the next few moonths I suggest leaving the pukekos alone. Thanks Cach Hunter1

geocooley junior has lost his hat while being carried around the
lake by his parents.&lt;br /&gt;
Help him find his hat, and he will show you where to find a cache.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can download the Wherigo Cartridge for this cache
&lt;a href="http://www.wherigo.com/cartridge/details.aspx?CGUID=9a158cf9-4022-454b-89a5-b39255f90198"&gt;
here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Go to the above waypoint then start the cartridge and play the game
to find the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This cache should be fun for younger (and young at heart)
cachers to try&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Although the cache is available at all times it is recommended
during daylight due to visual elements of the Wherigo
game&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;When you log this cache please also add a 'Played' Log to the
Wherigo page.&lt;br /&gt;
Also you can save your game and upload your save game file to the
Wherigo site to 'Unlock' the cartridge to show you have completed
it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Yarndleys bush is believed to be one of the largest remaining stands of Kahikatea in the North Island. Quite an eerie place in strong winds with all the trees creaking away. This is a replacement for the "Yandleys" cache but is hidden in a completely different place so even if you did the "original" you might still want to return to try this one as well - much easier!
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;It is a multi-cache which means the cache is not at the posted coordinates and you need to follow the instructions to find a two litre sistema container. It shouldn't take too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The listed coordinates take you to the start of the track&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a walk along the 10 minute loop track until you find the obvious structure. It is a loop so it doesn't matter which way you go. Climb the structure and count the number of vertical rails around the top platform ignoring the posts. Your count = A. At the base of the structure there is a tee-intersection in the path about 11 m away. Head NNW from the tee counting planks as you go. When the 'number of planks = A" look underneath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS - why is it called 'Candy Mountain"? My kids had some input. If you really really want to know search for "Charlie the Unicorn" on Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;

The Blue Spring, where this cache is located, is a source of the stream and delivers crystal blue water at a rate of 42 cubic metres per minute. 

Cache consists of a small Sistema box with notebook and pencil. When first placed, contained a soft lion toy, frog maraca, and a couple of scented highlighter pens. Note that ground around cache may be mushy after heavy rain.

Cache is so named as it was placed on the occasion of the first birthday of the littlest member of Team Fat Fish.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Cambridge has two crossing of the Waikato River, imaginatively known as the "High Level" and "Low Level" bridges.
One of these is over 100 years old and is recognised as an engineering masterpiece.

The above co-ordinates (close to the cache location) are a picnic area at the site of the boat landing from days when transport was primarily up the river. Cambridge was the southernmost landing heading upstream, with further boat travel blocked by the rapids visible from here below the Low Level bridge.

A circular walk on well developed paths, crossing both bridges is recommended and will uncover the facts required below. 

Further information is found at:
http://cambridgemuseum.org.nz/HeritageWalks/hwriver.htm


You require to find the opening year of both Waikato bridges.

Cache can be found at S37deg 53.(Low level year-1138) and S175deg 28.(High level year-1231)</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Hamilton city has few lookouts like this.  This is a very quiet spot, hidden in the middle of a suburb.

The elevation provides a good amount of privacy; the expanse is large and perfect for kids to kick a ball around or for a family picnic.

Entry avaliable from two sides. 
  1)Steep grass slope. Slippery when wet but no trouble. 
  2)Short walk up a foot path and couple dozen steps to top

Entry 1 is best for a pram, just a single low chain across an access way.
Entry 2 is best for parking and covert caching


Container is 400ml cammo sistema . 


The waypoint marks the centre of a water reservoir, which is covered by grass and surrounded by trees. 


Face South east and hold out your hand. Let the PALM guide you to your destination.


Beware: Muggle’s barking dog at south end of reserve. Its fenced and harmless but may attract muggle attention.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">St Paul's Church, Hairini, is one of the two oldest surviving buildings in the Waikato.
This area was where the Maori settlement of Rangiaowhia (now Hairini)  was situated.

There was a large Maori settlement with Catholic and Anglican churches on a ridge surrounded by peach groves and fields of wheat, maize and potatoes.
A mission station was founded at Rangiaowhia in the 1840s. St Paul’s Church, built in 1856
The station provided education as well as agricultural expertise and materials to local Ngati Hinetu and Ngati Apakura in what was one of the largest Maori settlements in the Waikato. 
By 1859 Rangiaowhia was described as a Maori town, with a racecourse and courthouse, growing wheat and other produce for the Auckland market.

One of the most controversial battles of the Waikato Wars took place here in 1864 when the British attacked an undefended Maori village destroying parts of it.
With the settlement subsequently abandoned, the building remained empty until it was repaired by the Anglican Diocese in the 1870s. St Paul's, as it became known, was then used as a parish church and briefly as a government school. It continues to be used for religious services.

The information needed is on site, access to the building is not needed.  If it is being used please respect their privacy.

This reserve was once the practise grounds for the Whaka Rugby Club, the club rooms being at the west end. Near the cache (when you find it) you will see a large spring, locally known as the THC blow out! This "hot spring" formed after the drillers had a few problems servicing a bore for the THC Hotel. Today the hotel pumps water from the spring, you can hear the pump from the cache if you listen carefully.

At the above coodinates you'll find a clue on a metal tag to solve the first of three waypoints, that will take you to the final cache location:

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">A puzzle cache (but not a particularly hard one) suitable for the everyday cacher (no extreme athletes required here). A relatively easy walk through a well maintained area, and even if there has been very heavy recent rain there should be little opportunity to get wet and muddy... UNLESS you happen to be trying to locate the cache at 1 am in the morning, in the middle of a thunder storm, just like one very keen Hamilton Cacher did :)

The cache puzzle itself is based upon a 16th century cipher devised by an english gent who is now listed amongst the names of famous philosophers from the Renaissance.
He was controversially postulated as being one of the major claimants to the Shakespeare authorship question, and reportedly had connection to 'secret societies' such as the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons. 

Like any cipher, decrypting it simply replys upon having the correct 'key'.
The ciphers creator used two versions (only one of which will work for this puzzle), and I have deliberately not included too much information about him so that a little research has to be conducted in order to obtain the correct decryption key.

[B]The co-ordinates listed above are not the cache location... [/B]it is merely a place-holder for the cache listing (the actual cache however is within a 2 km radius of this location).

The cache (a 200 ml sistema inside a TFM camo bag) can be located using the following encryption:

[B]BAAABBAABAAABBBBAAAAAABAAAABAABAAABAABAABAABBAABAAABBAA
AABABABBABBAABBBAAAAAABABABAAABAABBAABAA
AABABABBABBAABBBAAAAAABAAABAAAAABBAAABBBBAABABAAABABAAABABAB

ABBABABBAAAABAAAABABABAAABAABBAABAA
AABAAABAAAAABBAAABBBBAABAAABABABBABBAABBBAAAAAABABABAAABAABBAABAA [/B]

Stealth may have to be employed to get this cache, as there can be various volumes of foot traffic through this area at differing times of the day.</groundspeak:long_description>

Lake Rotokauri is part of the Waipa peat lake complex. At 77 hectares it is much bigger than the Hamilton Lake (55h). The lake level is controlled by a weir so water level fluctuations are unusual.

The lake had excellent water quality until 12 years ago when most of the healthy aquatic plants died.  A management committee of locals is working to restore the water quality. 
A sediment trap has been placed on the main inflow. The lake has been fenced to keep it free of stock and a riparian margin has been established between the lake and farming activities. Wetland areas adjoining the lake are also undergoing restoration. 
The highlight of the restoration project is a walkway which includes floating boardwalks.

Total time to complete the loop walk is 20 to 30 minutes from the car parks.

There are 3 car park entrances available. Coordinates provided for the 2 most used.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Kaipaki which I believe means food box or a place to cook food.
Rural New Zealand had a church a hall and a school.
The co ords given will take you to the Pukerimu Cemetery.  The Kaipaki Church and School were also here prior to being moved to their currents sites. 
I believe that they were moved due to the fact they were close to Cambridge
 At this location you will find a sticker with cords that will take you to the next building of interest in the area.  This building is 130 years old.  It was moved to the present site from the Cemetery early 1900s.
There is a sticker here to give the next co ords.  NOTE that the easting should end in 277 and NOT 227 as the sticker says

This will take you to the next building.  This was build in 1913 and was a focal point for social occasions.  There is a small cricket clubhouse and if you look into the field you can see the concrete pitch which isn't used anymore.  There were tables and seating under the trees so you could be in the shade while watching the action out in the centre.

The co ords here will take you to the final location.  This building was build in 1871 and moved from Pukerimu in 1901 to its current site.  It was rebuild in 1928 and it remains the same to this day.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Wow - after bagging this cache, you’ll never complain about climbing the office stairs again. I counted over 1600 of them (and that’s not including the ladders before you get there!)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 1224m, Henry Peak is part of the Mt Taranaki Northern Circuit and offers arguably the best views of ‘Naki in the entire park. The rest of the circuit is highly recommended and can be done as a day walk if you are fit (it took me 5.5 hours return from the carpark) but is normally done as a 2 or 3 day walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/7292a081-ecf3-447d-a5bb-73029b6b1bfb.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other routes up to this peak, but to fully enjoy the stairway experience (go on, you know you want to!), it's best to start from the car park on Egmont Road (see parking coordinates). It's around 13 km’s return, and with it's little ups and downs on the way it's a total ascent of about 1000m all up. It took me 1.5 hours each way, but most people would probably want to allow about twice that. Follow the signs to Kaiauai Track (see map). There is a swing bridge, a bit of boulder hopping and a couple of short but steep scrambles involved in the first half. Ignore the warning sign telling you that the track gets rougher just after you’ve clawed your way to the top of the steepest bit - the track from here on has been upgraded and is now excellent!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is a camo'd 1 litre Sistema containing logbook, pencil and trades.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We left for Holly Hut from the North Egmont Center at 6:30pm on Friday night after obtaining hut passes and dinner. We made it to the hut right on nightfall and stayed the night witha nutter from the Netherlands who was wearing only sneakers (from Mangorei Rd to Holly Hut via Henry in one day...) and eating only plum jam sandwiches!

We went to see Bells Falls, and left after getting back to the hut. Made it in good time across the very very wet swamp in the rain and up to the Pouakai Hut by 1pm. Get in to take off our boots and socks and some pineapple lumps to see that a guy has signed the intentions log saying "Dropped off 12 sleeping bags for the tour group tonight." Darn it. We left the door open while we were in here, and the mist was rolling in through the door, literally. There's a beautiful view of the inside of a cloud.. We decided we would make it back to North Egmont via Henry Peak by 7:30pm, assuming we could safely cross the river. 

We made it up here to find the cache, in very good condition, and no good view. Oh well. Got back to the car at 6:30pm, doing two thirds of what we were going to split into two days in a single day..

Your caches are always very rewarding, Mr. Gerbil. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Fantastic Four is a fictional superhero team appearing in comic
books published by Marvel Comics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The four core individuals traditionally associated with the
Fantastic Four, who gained superpowers after exposure to cosmic
rays during a scientific mission to outer space, are: Mr.
Fantastic, a scientific genius and the leader of the group, who can
stretch his body into incredible lengths and shapes; the Invisible
Woman, who can render herself invisible and project powerful force
fields; the Human Torch, who can generate flames, surround himself
with them and fly; and the monstrous Thing, their grumpy but
benevolent friend, who possesses superhuman strength and
endurance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=

&lt;br /&gt;
The Fantastic Four are planning to meet at a secret location as
part of a mission to once again defeat Doctor Doom. They have
encrypted the co-ordinates of the location so that only the 4 of
them can find it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They plan to meet at 837313971554027. Can you join them to
help?&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Almost, but not quite a drive up - you'll have to take a few steps to reach this cache.

One of those VERY historical places that is missed on the drive through the King Country.
It was also affirmed that the Kingship of the maori people was to be hereditary in his family.  

Potatau had been selected as King by a meeting of Chiefs of the maori tribes held at Pukawa in November 1856; but before he would accept the position, Potatau expressed his wish that the matter be submitted to his senior cousins among the Maniapoto tribe.  

The chiefs of the Maniapoto tribe who deliberated and who made the decision were: Taonui, Hauauru, Haupokia, Te Wetini, Tuhoro and Te Kanawa.    

The historical site of the meeting place Haurua, is at the Waitomo Golf Course across the road from the main gateway to Rereamanu Marae. 

Cache is quite close to the road WATCH YOUR LITTLE CHILDREN, THE ROAD IS VERY CLOSE.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This can be a busy, busy place. It depends on the time of day. And speaking of time, the area where the cache is hidden is not available all the time - the gates are locked at night. The cache is outside, but there are roofs and buildings that can make good GPS coverage difficult.

The terrain is very easy, however the placement probably means that the cache cannot be grabbed from a wheelchair, hence the 1.5 terrain rating.

We have provided clear and specific clues - see how you go without them first though.

At most times, extreme stealth will be required. We've rated it a difficulty 3 because of the 'muggleness' of the area. Please be careful so as not to give away the cache.

You will need your own pen or pencil.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This is a tour to several points of interest and passes a couple of
others. A 14 km drive from the first waypoint to the cache. You
must collect information as you go to find the subsequent waypoints
and the final cache. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The required information is available from the road side with no
need to enter any private property.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 There are fairly safe places to stop and park at each spot. &lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">At the general location of the posted co-ordinates, you find a
vessel with some "interesting characters" in it marooned in a
paddock. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 A = the number of "interesting characters" in the vessel &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 B = the number of letters in the name of the vessel &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 C = A + B &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 D = B – A &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Your next stop is S 37° 48.DBC E 175° DA.71C &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here you will find an information board and map. Note two things;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 E = the map grid number of the place you visited first &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 F = the reference number of the place you visited first &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 G = E + F - 4 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Your next stop is S 37° 46.948-F E 175° 26.AG &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 When you arrive you should spot another vehicle somewhat stranded
in a paddock. "What is that doing there?". Note the first letter of
the call sign.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 H = the number that letter is in the alphabet + 1 - 20&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Your next stop and the location of the cache is S 37° 46.HDC E
175° 2C.1HC &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The cache is a 2L camo painted container. It contained a log,
pencil, and swaps when placed. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Please replace the cache in the same spot and well
hidden.</groundspeak:long_description>

verifies your visit to the site.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ruapehu is one of the world's most active volcanoes and the largest
active volcano in New Zealand. It is the highest point in the North
Island and includes three major peaks: Tahurangi (2,797 m), Te
Heuheu (2,755 m) and Paretetaitonga (2,751 m). The deep, active
crater is between the peaks and fills with a crater lake between
major eruptions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/80ddbaeb-9be8-4baf-93a9-4f1e1da8ff3b.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Hazards posed by volcanoes usually bring to mind lava flows and
clouds of ash. Yet some of the worst hazards emerge long after the
eruptions have stopped. Lahars are mudflows of water, volcanic ash,
and volcanic rocks. Melting snow and rain can form lakes that sit
heavily and uneasily in volcanic calderas. If the volcanic lake
breaks through the surrounding rock, a lahar pours down the
volcano&amp;rsquo;s flank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Between major eruptions, a warm acidic crater lake forms, fed by
melting snow. Major eruptions may completely expel the lake water.
Where a major eruption has deposited a tephra dam across the lake's
outlet, the dam may collapse after the lake has refilled and risen
above the level of its normal outlet, the outrush of water causing
a large lahar. More than 60 lahars have been recorded in the
Whangaehu Valley below the mountain since the 1860s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The 1945 eruption emptied the crater lake and dammed the outlet
with tephra. The crater slowly refilled with water, until on
December 24, 1953 the tephra dam collapsed causing a lahar in the
Whangaehu River. The lahar caused the Tangiwai disaster, with the
loss of 151 lives, when the Tangiwai railway bridge across the
Whangaehu River collapsed while the lahar was in full flood, just
before an express train crossed it. It was already known that the
river had partially undermined one of the bridge piers and the
lahar finished the job, causing the bridge to collapse. Although
warned of the collapsed bridge, the train driver was unable to stop
the train in time and 6 of the carriages fell into the river.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Spectacular eruptions occurred during 1995 and 1996. Ruapehu had
been showing signs of increased activity since late November 1994,
with elevated crater lake temperatures and a series of eruptions
that increased in intensity over about nine months. Several lahar
were observed, both in the Whangaehu River and other areas of the
mountain, between September 18 and September 25, 1995, indicating
the crater lake was being emptied by the eruptions. The Department
of Conservation immediately issued hazard warnings and advised
people to keep off the mountain, thus ending the ski season. The
eruption cloud disrupted air travel, occasionally closing airports
and the central North Island airspace. Episodic eruptions continued
until the end of November 1995.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ruapehu erupted at 10.30pm on 4 October 2006. The small eruption
created a volcanic earthquake of magnitude 2.8, sending a water
plume 200 m into the air and 6-m waves crashing into the wall of
the crater.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On 18 March 2007, the 7 metre tephra dam which had been holding
back the crater lake burst, sending a lahar down the mountain. The
escaping water gouged out rocks and earth and other debris carrying
them down the mountain. An estimated 1.4 million cubic metres of
mud, rock, and water thundered down the Whangaehu river, with the
standing wave reaching a height of 4 metres.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/0f6df7fc-82d7-4b5c-8635-8fec43e856a3.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Department of Conservation had received warning signals from
the lahar warning system (ERLAWS) at around 10:30 that morning and
closed all major roads in the area and shut down the main rail
system for the North Island. Luckily the river banks held and no
major spill overs occurred. No serious damage was done and no one
was injured. One family was trapped for around 24 hours after the
lahar swept away the access route to their home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
At this location, close to where the rail bridge of 1953 was swept
away, there is a memorial to the victims, survivors and rescuers of
the Tangiwha Disaster. Until 18 March 2007, this was a popular spot
for travelers to rest. A toilet block was sited here. After the
morning of 18 March 2007, this area was covered in acidic mud,
which had flowed from the crater rim, down the Whangaehu channel,
and rising to several metres at the bend behind where the toilets
stood, and up and over the bank. It had followed the same path of
Christmas Eve 1953. All that was left of the toilet block was one
pipe embedded into the bank (There was a regular geocache adjacent
in a flax bush at the time of the lahar).&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/0a8debad-1b92-431e-8b08-50bf82ff9cac.jpg" align="right" width="150" /&gt; At WP1 you need to use some special equipment with Harald’s namesake, and enquire from him the location of the final. If you can’t get him to show the details, try sending him something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the final you are looking for a 2litre click-clack box, and you don’t need to go on any private property at any point during your mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waypoint 1 is at 37 49 ABC-342 175 17 DEF+655&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As always, it is important you re-hide the box well
&lt;p&gt;Radionut50 acknowledges Papa Bear Left for the inspiration on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="background:yellow;"&gt;Caution - the intermediate point for this puzzle was moved in August 2012, and the puzzle maths changed to suit - if you have solved this before August, but not found the final, you will need to do your sums again!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The year is 50 B.C. Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans.
Well, not entirely...&lt;br /&gt;
One small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the
invaders...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Adventures of Asterix is a series of French comic strips
written by René Goscinny and illustrated by Albert Uderzo. The
series first appeared in French in the magazine Pilote on 29
October 1959. As of 2008, 33 comic books in the series have been
released. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/af94166d-eb5d-495f-b5c7-fe5c0705d940.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The series follows the exploits of a village of ancient Gauls as
they resist Roman occupation. They do so by means of a magic
potion, brewed by their druid, which gives the recipient superhuman
strength. The main character, Asterix, along with his companions
have various adventures. In many cases, this leads them to travel
to various countries around the world, though other books are set
in and around their village. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mr Northwood has been a fan of the Asterix books for more years
than he cares to admit. Here's a cache to test other fans and,
hopefully, gain a few new ones.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You need to review the pictures below, answer the questions, and
get the correct coordinates. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 1. What is the name of Asterix's best friend? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The Gauls are afraid the what might fall on their heads? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. Looking at Figure 1, who is this? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. Whose wife is in Figure 2? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5. What does the man in Figure 3 sell? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
6. Asterix joins the Roman army during one adventure to rescue who?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
7. What is the missing word in Figure 4? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
8. Who is Asterix about to fight in Figure 5? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, by Toutatis, they get harder. It's tough getting some
questions "Googlix" won't answer in 2 minutes. The answers are from
the English editions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A = the number of letters in the answer to 1 + 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
B = Add 1 to the number of letters in the answer to 8. What is the
square root of the result?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
C = the number of letters in the answer to 2 + 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
D = the number of letters in the answer to 5 + 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
E = the number of letters in the answer to 6 - 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
F = the number of vowels in the answer to 7 + 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
G = the number of letters in the answer to 3 + 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
H = the number of letters in the answer to 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At S 37 4A.BCD E 175 1E.FGH, you will find an intermediate cache.
This holds the coordinates to the final. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The intermediate has been placed with permission. Apparently,
there's an active neighbour watch due to some recent untoward
activities - hence the "not recommended at night". There is no need
to trample around the garden. The container is magnetic and needs
to be replaced carefully. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The final is a 3L sistema, please replace out of sight.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A couple of decades ago, we lived in a renovated 1950s bungalow
nearby, with a huge backyard, vegetable gardens, play area, pool
etc...... And in the evenings we would go for a walk in this
area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My, how the area has changed.&lt;br /&gt;
Now, you will see 12 room bedsit apartments, sharing ONE kitchen,
laundry and lounge.&lt;br /&gt;
You will see many apartments squeezed onto one section.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have placed a micro cache here to show you the changing
accomodation in this area. &lt;br /&gt;
High Density at it's best!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;There is NO NEED to go onto private property.&lt;br /&gt;
BEWARE of muggles at all times. They can appear from either
direction, and also if you are loud or obvious, they will peer at
you from many angles.&lt;br /&gt;
DISCRETION PLEASE.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is an urban micro cache - bring your own pen please.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Again, I remind you - stealth required. Do NOT let yourself be
observed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Please please.. put it back in the white circular mounting when you are finished..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;AND note - the log is INSIDE the bison tube within the camo cache container...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Logging Etiquette:&lt;/b&gt; Geocache hiders sometimes go through a great deal of planning to place their caches. As a result, they'd like to hear your feedback on whether you liked or disliked any aspect of the hide, or if you feel that some cache maintenance is required.&lt;br /&gt;
Single word, acronym, or emoticon logs may be easier when you have a lot of caches to log, but it doesn't tell the hider or other finders anything about your adventure (or lack thereof) in finding the cache. Please keep this in mind when entering your log.&lt;br /&gt;

This is a walkway. Follow the track (expect some damp patches along the way) and sign posting towards the picnic area. 

To find this cache, you have to use your powers of observation as you walk along the track. First, look carefully at the 8 pictures in the gallery. As you follow the track, can you identify the items in the pictures? 

The first waypoint is in, on or near, one of the items pictured. But which one?
The second waypoint is also situated in, on or under one of the items pictured. 
As for the final cache, is it in, on or near something in the pictures? 
Well, you’ll just have to find that out for yourself.

This is our first cache. It was designed with children in mind to encourage them to use their observational skills. We hope you enjoy finding this cache as much as we enjoyed constructing it!
Finally, we hppos love hippos and would welcome them, in particular, to this retreat. 
Wild animals as swaps are also encouraged.

Note: At the end of the track (approx.700m) there's a large clearing. This is a good spot for a family picnic with lots of space for family sporting activities.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Hamilton's first hospital resulted from the stationing of the Fourth Waikato Militia in Hamilton in 1864.  A military hospital was set up on land in Bridge Street which is now occupied by the Hamilton Central Police Station.

The current Waikato Hospital is on a large site off Pembroke Street. The hospital is the main campus for the Waikato District Health Board which employs more than 5500 people and provides hospital and health services to more than 355,000 people in a region covering eight per cent of New Zealand.

There is a major building program under way on the Waikato Hospital site. This cache is on one of the recently commissioned areas.

This can be a busy spot.  The terrain is very easy. There is 15 minute parking close by. At most times, reasonable stealth will be required. Please be careful so as not to give away the cache. Replace it out of sight.

You will need your own pen or pencil.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Grandstand is one of Hamilton’s most loved historic buildings. 

It began life in Cambridge in 1879 where it was built originally for the Cambridge Jockey Club. Later, it was purchased by the Hamilton Racing Club, which meant it was dismantled in 1886, and moved by rail to Hamilton to be re-erected at Claudelands in 1887.  In 1926 it was again relocated to the site where it stood until May 2008, immediately adjacent to Heaphy Terrace. The final move brought it to where it stands today. In close vicinity to the children’s playground, and of course, overlooking the oval.

The Grandstand has been beautifully restored. It is now being used as a kiosk for lunches and snacks and as a function space suitable for dinners, weddings, and special corporate events. With a fresh new look The Grandstand has been transformed into something really stylish. Come and check it out! You’ll have to get up close and personal with the building to find the cache.

You’ll enjoy the whole area, I’m sure. It’s a lovely park that offers something for the whole family. The Grandstand belongs to the City Council and therefore is there or the whole community to enjoy.

There is plenty of parking in close proximity to the cache which is situated away from the commercial part of the Grand Stand.

The cache is a micro, which contains a log and pencil only. There is no room for swaps.</groundspeak:long_description>

A hive for bees
A nest for birds

My hair is mostly curly, fuzzy
Snaggy, shaggy, ratty, matty 
(maybe a bit scratchy)
Look in here, it’s so eezy peezy,
No, not shining, gleaming, streaming
But blackened, waxen and camoed
… … …

Then my hair's too short

Look in here

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When I first stumbled upon geocaching almost a year ago, I did not
foresee myself becoming such a geo-junkie. But by fifty finds I was
definitely hooked, and by a hundred there was no turning back.
After a trawl through global geocaching sites I saw a DO NOT FIND
cache, and answering YES to some of the questions, I considered
signing up for CA (Cacheaholics Anonymous) but the problem is that
I DON'T WANT TO STOP!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And neither do you! So, to celebrate my 20th cache placement, and
in recognition of officially having a geocaching addiction for the
past year, I decided to do this. Hopefully not finding this cache
may help others with a geocaching problem. I have recommended this
cache is done at night in the attributes to help hide your shame if
you should find yourself weak and unable to resist this
cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do you have a problem with geocaching? Are You a Number Ho? Only
you can answer these questions for yourself. If you've got a
problem it's time to admit it and deal with it. Not doing this
cache could be your first step.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Answering the following quiz may help to put your relationship with
geocaching into perspective for you. If you end up answering "yes"
to three or more questions, you may want to take a good look how
your life is affected by geocaching.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Do you get excited when you find a new park?&lt;br /&gt;
2. Do you actually look forward to visiting the inlaws?&lt;br /&gt;
3. Is your driveway covered with spray painted cache box
silhouettes?&lt;br /&gt;
4. Do you get distracted watching movies because you're always
scanning the scenery thinking: "That would be a GREAT place for a
cache!"&lt;br /&gt;
5. Do you spend most of your lunch hours in the $2 shop looking for
trades?&lt;br /&gt;
6. Does your car have a dashboard cellphone holder, yet has never
held a cellphone?&lt;br /&gt;
7. Were you ever late to your brothers/sisters wedding because
someone hid a new cache in the area?&lt;br /&gt;
8. Is your idea of &amp;ldquo;close by&amp;rdquo; anything within a hundred
mile radius?&lt;br /&gt;
9. Is your idea of a good date claiming &amp;ldquo;first find&amp;rdquo; on
a cache?&lt;br /&gt;
10. Does your wedding invitation feature a Difficulty / Terrain
rating?&lt;br /&gt;
11. Are your family vacations based on cache density?&lt;br /&gt;
12. Do you wonder if there are any caches in Heaven?&lt;br /&gt;
13. Is your lawn a foot long, your landscaping full of weeds and
your back fence falling down because you're ...ahem...a little too
busy on weekends?&lt;br /&gt;
14. Are you are thinking of moving to a more cache dense
environment?&lt;br /&gt;
15. If someone asks for directions, would you reply "352 metres
northwest plus or minus 4 metres?"&lt;br /&gt;
16. Can you read the "additional hints" quite naturally without
clicking on the "Decrypt" link?&lt;br /&gt;
17. Do you stick your hand into any hole in the ground or any bush
with reckless abandon?&lt;br /&gt;
18. If a fellow cacher becomes unemployed, are you jealous?&lt;br /&gt;
19. When you ask your kids "Wanna go to a new park today?" Do they
reply, "Aww Dad, not ANOTHER geocache!"?&lt;br /&gt;
20. When you're driving down the road, and all of a sudden your GPS
goes, "BEEP BEEP"... Do your kids say at the same time, "ARRIVING
AT DESTINATION!"?&lt;br /&gt;
21. Does your dog get excited not when you grab car keys, but when
she sees you grab your GPS?&lt;br /&gt;
22. Are you the only man at a tupperware party?&lt;br /&gt;
23. Do you tell your spouse that you're going out to S 37 47.7 E
175 16.2 and he/she knows which outfit to wear?&lt;br /&gt;
24. Are you magnetically drawn to the Rubbermaid container
selection every time you visit the supermarket?&lt;br /&gt;
25. Is your child's lunch box an ammo can?&lt;br /&gt;
26. Are the words you long to hear from your significant other:
"There's a new cache?"&lt;br /&gt;
27. Do your co-workers no longer ask "how was your weekend?"
Instead they ask "how many cache's did you find?"&lt;br /&gt;
28. Do you always carry a caching repair and retrieval toolkit in
the car, but have no idea where the spare tyre and jumper cables
are?&lt;br /&gt;
29. Does your significant other call you home to dinner through the
forums?&lt;br /&gt;
30. Have you ever told your other half that you just need to pop
out to get some dog biscuits and come back with a FTF?
&lt;p&gt;This cache is here to help. This cache is a test to see how
addicted to geocaching you really are. &lt;font color="red"&gt;YOUR GOAL
IS TO NOT FIND THIS CACHE.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that there are those among us (and you know who you
are!) who, when they look at the page showing their 20 nearest
caches, see nothing but a perfect page full of finds. Then that new
cache comes along and spoils your pristine page. It sits there at
the top of the list. Taunting you. Staring at you like a giant
unblinking eye. It calls out to you. "Fiiiind meeee..." You comply,
even though the sun is barely peeking over the horizon. If you're
lucky, you score a First to Find, and then race back to log it in
and remove it from your top 20 list. Ahhhhh. All is in order
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is, how strong are you? Can you resist searching
out this cache? You have nothing to gain from finding it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; There is no invigorating hike, no physical challenge
whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; There are no breathtaking views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; There is no fascinating history lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; You can park within 3m of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; There are no FTF prizes or other cool pieces of cache
swag to trade for. In fact, the cache contains no more than a
logbook and pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/90e4062c-9690-4be6-8401-8a29f2518e54.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is absolutely nothing of interest here. The idea for this
cache is not even my own. Even the text is blatantly stolen from
several similar ones. The ONLY thing you have to reward yourself
from searching out this cache is just adding another find to your
total. No glory. Just a number. Just another lame drive-by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To really test the severity of your addiction, I've hidden this
cache on the main drag into town where you will probably be driving
past on a regular basis. For those of you who are not strong enough
to resist, and have crawled here after beating yourself up about it
- help is near at hand. You also get a chance to turn over a new
leaf and sign the Cacheaholics Anonymous roll sheet. You must
provide an ONLINE essay of at least 30 words as to why you are NOT
hooked on caching. If you are a recovering cacheaholic, and can
resist the temptation, please log as a DNF and share your success
story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/c10585fd-d9f0-40fe-bfca-fb975f3cbd8f.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow Winston's lead when he kicked his geocaching habit, and
show the world how strong you are. You can stop Geocaching anytime
you want. Really you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Fiiiind meeee..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acknowledgement:&lt;/b&gt; This cache idea is not my own. I must
give credit to The Cheeseheads, the creator of the original "Do Not
Find This Cache" (GC7086), and all of those thereafter who have
been innovators on this theme.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>It's bad enough that you're looking for this. Do you think I'm going to be responsible for helping along your addiction by actually telling you that four two two is pointing at you?</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Although the concept of green belts was first proposed back in the 1930s in the UK, it was much later that planning authorities brought the idea to New Zealand. A green belt is an area surrounding a city that has been designated by the city’s planners as a region for restricted development.  The fundamental aim of green belt policy is to prevent urban sprawl and to retain areas of natural, undeveloped land where city dwellers can enjoy open spaces.
The stated objectives of green belt areas are to:
•	protect natural or semi-natural environments
•	ensure city folk have access to countryside
•	improve air quality within urban areas
•	provide educational and recreational opportunities

In Hamilton we have our very own green belt, which Hamiltonians can enjoy the many benefits of:
•	walking, camping and biking close to the city
•	habitat for native trees and plants and grazing for ponies
•	tennis courts, a cycling track and soccer fields
There’s also a Marae and our beautiful Hamilton Gardens. 

The green belt seems the perfect place to set up a resort for GCs and TBs. It’s clean and green and there are leisure activities aplenty -just what a travel-weary geocoin or travel bug needs for some rest and recreation.  

Since the cache is dedicated to geocoins and travel bugs, please make sure you replace the container very carefully and with stealth, so as not to divulge the hide to any lurking muggles.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Taupo, the most active rhyolitic volcano of the Taupo volcanic zone, is a large, roughly 35-km-wide caldera with poorly defined margins. It is a type example of an "inverse volcano" that slopes inward towards the most recent vent location. The Taupo caldera, now filled by Lake Taupo, largely formed as a result of the voluminous eruption of the Oruanui Tephra about 22,600 years before present (BP). This was the largest known eruption at Taupo, producing about 1170 cu km of tephra. This eruption was preceded during the late Pleistocene by the eruption of a large number of rhyolitic lava domes north of Lake Taupo. Large explosive eruptions have occurred frequently during the Holocene from many vents within Lake Taupo and near its margins. The most recent major eruption took place about 1800 years BP from at least three vents along a NE-SW-trending fissure centered on the Horomotangi Reefs. This extremely violent eruption was New Zealand's largest during the Holocene and produced the thin but widespread phreatoplinian Taupo Ignimbrite, which covered 20,000 sq km of North Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/log/5533a609-178c-4f21-9585-6ac836987a5f.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Oruanui eruption 26,500 years ago.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest eruption from Taupo occurred 26,500 years ago producing 300 km³ of ignimbrite, 500 km³ of pumice and ash fall and a unknown volume of material inside the caldera. The Oruanui eruption is thought to have formed the caldera now filled by Lake Taupo, but this large eruption also shows the influence of lake water in its fine grain size and abundant evidence for heavy rain during the eruption. This implies the existence of a large lake prior to the eruption. The Oruanui ignimbrite is seen in many road cuttings about Taupo, draped by the layers of younger tephra. Fine ash from this eruption has been found throughout New Zealand and in many offshore core samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the major Oruanui eruption, there was a change in the conditions of the magma beneath Taupo. It is thought a new batch of magma rose high in the crust as the material erupted after Oruanui has a different composition, and was much hotter. The vents for the post-Oruanui eruptions appear to be south of the earlier vents and most are now under Lake Taupo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/log/42085bd1-4c65-48cd-9221-8e9528e2a3d8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IGNIMBRITE ROCK:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignimbrite is a volcanic deposit formed by a pyroclastic flow, which is a surface-hugging eruption cloud of very hot gas and volcanic particles that moves rapidly (up to 100 km/hr) across the ground surface, away from the vent. . Ignimbrite layers can be soft and full of pumice such as the land surface around Taupo (from the Taupo eruption 1800 years ago); or hard rock where the deposit has been very thick and hot enough for the particles to fuse together, forming the hard rock as seen today in bluffs around Lake Taupo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you drive south along the eastern shore of Lake Taupo you will notice the huge blocks of hard Ignimbrite rock forming cliffs around some of the road bluffs, particularly the section south of Hatepe at Bulli Point, Ohoumahanga Point and Toki Point. Do not attempt to stop at these bluff corners as parking is impossible and fully laden trucks sometimes fall over the edge.&lt;br /&gt;
You may be amazed to know that early one morning we did spot a small hiker's tent camped on the highest bluff corner, perched between the road edge and the drop-off....yikes!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the lake shore at Mission Bay Reserve sits a block of hard Ignimbrite rock locally known as Rubik's Rock. It appears as a block but it could be a deeper column, we haven’t dug down deep enough to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;TO LOG THIS EARTHCACHE answer the following questions and take a photograph:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
1. Provide a PHOTOGRAPH of yourself at Rubiks Rock, clearly showing yourself/GPS and the rock with the lake in the background to enable us to keep a record of lake level fluctuations during the different seasons.(Photo to be uploaded with your online log entry).&lt;br /&gt;
2. Roughly measure the Rubik’s Rock and calculate how many cubic metres of rock it contains.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Describe how YOU think this block came to be sitting here on the lake shore. Imaginative answers are encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Name two other nearby lakeside locations where huge slabs of Ignimbrite rock are clearly visible on the roadside.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please do not post your answers in your log entry. Email your answers to us to receive permission to log, then upload your photo with your online log entry.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Night Visits, you won't see anything in the dark and your photograph is very important, we would like to continue the photographic record of Rubik's Rock which began with our previous cache &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=c7c500dc-ab9a-46d6-a74b-52f09ad5e2ba"&gt;GC191FF now archived.&lt;/a&gt; It is interesting to see the different lake levels, the weather conditions and seasonal changes.&lt;/p&gt;

offensive by people who don't wear underwear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Is it an egg salad sandwich? No way,
it's Captain Underpants! Faster than a speeding waistband...more
powerful than boxer shorts...and able to leap tall buildings
without getting a wedgie...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This easy find combines geocaching with fine literature(??). It
is based on Dav Pilkey&amp;rsquo;s popular children&amp;rsquo;s book series
Captain Underpants, who uses his super powers to fight for truth,
justice, and all that is pre-shrunk and cottony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Pippy P. Poopypants is one of Captain
Underpants&amp;rsquo; arch nemesis, and may be the greatest scientific
genius the world has ever known. Unfortunately, he has such a silly
name that nobody takes him seriously. In &amp;ldquo;Captain Underpants
and the Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants&amp;rdquo;, the evil
scientist hates his name so much that he changes it to the much
more sensible "Tippy Tinkletrousers".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He now DEMANDS that you get a new name too. Either peruse
Chapter 15 of the book, or if you don't have a copy handy (shame on
you!), go online at &lt;a href=
"http://apps.scholastic.com/captainunderpants/NameGame/play.htm"&gt;visit
link&lt;/a&gt; to find your new name. Just for fun, you are encouraged to
sign your silly name in the online log. If you are too embarrased
to reveal to the world your true identity, I won't use the
"Shrinky-Pig 2000" on your log entry, but you may have to stay
after school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all you really NEED to do to claim your smiley is sign the
logbook. Pretty simple really (hee hee). However, what you really
WANT to do for some extra 'brownie' points, is to live the legend
and post a photo of yourself decked out in our hero's costume
provided. Just pray that no muggles are walking past when
you&amp;rsquo;re posing for the photo in all your magnificence. Go on,
you know you want to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is in acknowledgement of Zorgon&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Dark
Dark Forest&amp;rdquo; GCM2MZ which has recently been archived after
seeing over 4 years of action. There are 5 entrances to this
forest, but they all link up and you won&amp;rsquo;t have to walk more
than 15 minutes even if you do the whole loop. You do not need to
go beyond any fences. Satellite coverage is sketchy, so you may
want to check the spoiler photo. It's pretty dark in here, so you
may find a torch useful (although not necessary) in locating the 18
litre container. And for putting on the outfit...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've included a few copies of some classic Captain Underpants
music on CD for your listening pleasure as trades. They include
such family favourites as 'Super Diaper Baby Foo-Foo' and 'Oops I
Farted'.&lt;/p&gt;
Many thanks to Zorgon for the spot, and to OmaGosh for his many
hours of diligent prior "research". Also to 49er princess for
colouring in the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;
Have fun, but watch out for The Wicked Wedgy Woman when you're
bending over! Tra-la-laaaa!&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Most people would agree that the greatest wall of all is in China. Nevertheless, there are many other spectacular walls scattered around the world, which also offer something special. Many are quite ancient, such as Hadrian’s Wall and were originally built as fortifications, by inhabitants protecting their particular city or region from invasion. 

In modern times, many of these amazing structures have become tourist attractions. There are some beautiful examples of walled cities, for example, in York in England, in Rothenburg oder Tauber in Germany and Ypres in Belgium.  Ypres is particularly significant to New Zealanders, as many of our forefathers left from inside this fortification to go to battle in Flanders Fields to ‘fight for King and country’. 

Aside from the famous walls of the world, there are the infamous ones too. Some of which no longer exist. Well, not in the state of their former self. Yet, these walls have left a lasting legacy. One such example is the Berlin Wall. Unfortunately, in the world today, there are still places where walls have been and are being built, to segregate.  

So, having talked about walls that fortify and segregate, I suppose one could say the Great Wall of Hamilton also fortifies. But not against invasion, rather it is against subsidence.  Yet, had the original shape of the landscape never been changed from how Mother Earth had originally intended it to be, the Great Wall of Hamilton would never have been constructed.

- quote "A Tall Wall Story" - courtesy of Wintec

The imposing Anglesea Street retaining wall is a landmark in Hamilton city. It was also one of many risk factors for the Siteworx project team to consider and manage when they built Wintec’s new City Campus Hub in 2007. The new Hub building is approximately 4.4 metres closer to the wall than the former G Block. So, just what impact was this likely to make on the stability of the wall? To fnd out, the Siteworx team commissioned engineers to do a geological assessment. 

The imposing Anglesea Street ‘wall’ has an intriguing history.
The end of this finger of land intruded into the town centre. In the late 
1930s, after considerable local controversy, the finger’s end was severed by the steam shovels of a businessman and former Mayor of Hamilton, JR Fow. The remaining cliff face was concreted over, and the great grey wall on Anglesea Street was known as ‘Fow’s folly’ for a time, according to That Place on the Hill by John Tonkin-Covell. 
According to the recent engineering assessment, the 10 metre high ‘wall’ is in fact a 150mm thick reinforcing concrete facing protecting the earth behind it. Interestingly, the ‘wall’ was originally higher, at approximately 14 metres above road level, but was cut down by about three metres in the early 1990’s when the campus was extended. 
After thorough ground investigation and testing, the engineers concluded that timber piles driven to a depth of over 10 metres would be required to support the new building and minimise any impact on the nearby wall. 
So, the huge piles were installed, and Hamiltonians can rest easy safe in the knowledge that the Anglesea Street wall is here to stay for some time yet. - unquote

For a student's project on the wall check out the following link: http://www.andreawilkinson.com/thirtysomething/2007/03/14/behind-this-wall-beyond-those-buildings/

In a strange sort of twist, Hamilton’s Great Wall does segregate. It segregates the campus of Wintec from the city centre and as far as invasion goes. Well, it could just about be under invasion itself when geocachers read about this cache.  Finally, we couldn’t say it’s a tourist attraction in Hamilton. In fact, some folk would have something quite derogatory to say about it.  However, if stealth is not used to retrieve this cache, then just maybe Hamilton’s non-caching community could be cajoled into thinking that the latest tourist attraction to hit town revolves around Hamilton’s Great Wall.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;The name Te Awamutu refers to the end of the river; the Manga-o-hoi stream.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canoes could navigate the Manga-o-hoi stream as far as Te Awamutu and from then travel had to be overland.&lt;br /&gt;
At Te Awamutu,was Otawhao, a pa on the hill which is currently Wallace Terrace.&lt;br /&gt;
Otawhao, named after the Tainui tupuna Tawhao, was the first visited by missionaries in 1834.&lt;br /&gt;
It was at Otawhao Pa that the first church is recorded in1838 and where in 1839 Reverend Ashwell asked the Whare Kura (Christian Maori) to leave and set up a separate community at "Awamutu".&lt;br /&gt;
It was this act which led to the establishment of the Otawhao Mission station.&lt;br /&gt;
At the conclusion of the Waikato Wars ex-militia and settlers became the first Europeans to populate Te Awamutu.&lt;br /&gt;
This was followed by the opening up of European settlement to the area with the railway in 1880, and the further development of the economy through farming, especially dairying.&lt;br /&gt;
Te Awamutu has taken the rose as a symbol, and is self proclaimed Rose Capital of New Zealand. It is an area of great historical interest,with old churches, pa sites, redoubt sites and battlegrounds nearby.&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located in Centennial Park, a reserve, set up at the base of the Otawhao Pa Site.&lt;br /&gt;
Access is from parking area in Rewi Street.&lt;br /&gt;
The reserve is flanked by a skateboard park and BMX track, and a walking track above park does attract muggles with dogs.&lt;br /&gt;
Entrance to reserve is on Rewi Street to small oval lake and fountain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Container replaced and is now a small camo jar.&lt;br /&gt;
Please cover up well as to not be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

A 400ml Sistema camo container, placed along part of the esplanade walkway looptrack,near to the floating boardwalk.&lt;br /&gt;
Worth a look if you have the time.&lt;br /&gt;
Cache contains,log and pencil and swap items.&lt;br /&gt;
Walking the track is fairly easy with one downhill gradient leading to a stile you will have to cross.&lt;br /&gt;
Carry on to GZ.&lt;br /&gt;
If you reach the floating boardwalk,you have gone too far.&lt;br /&gt;
Recommend Parking at rest area.&lt;br /&gt;
Please dont park on reserve grassed area. Main Highway can be very busy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;Please dont remove the Novelty Pencil container.. It keeps the pencils dry and your witts about you!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Farm Dog
Aunt Daisy
Race Days
The new wringer washing machine
All Black history....

and so much more.

The architecturally designed walkway connects the main street (Maniapoto Street) with Wahanui Crescent and the historic Otorohanga Railway Station.
It is paved all the way through.
Not much opportunity to place a cache, but we found a spot.... down low, but where muggles may linger.....  
Totally wheelchair friendly.
Just be discrete please.

Oh, and BTW - check out the public toilets near the old Railway Station - they have to be the BEST in New Zealand!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is dedicated to those people who have been publishing
the frustrating Waikato puzzle caches that have caused many hours
of head banging hair pulling, nail biting and desperate Googling
when I should really have been sleeping. Did I say frustrating?
Butterfingers - I meant to say "fun, challenging, satisfying and
enjoyable"; at least that's what ends up in the logs .....
eventually after all the pins have been pulled out of the
effergies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory here is that if those who shall not be named are busy
trying to figure out a puzzle themselves they won't have time to
put together another one to add to the torture :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Puzzle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a photograph of a security alarm keypad. Determine the
four digit alarm code then use this number below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1st Digit = A&lt;br /&gt;
2nd Digit = B&lt;br /&gt;
3rd Digit = C&lt;br /&gt;
4th Digit = D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need to enter private property or go through gates to access
the cache. The cache is a large ex-army ammo box and can be found

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Information taken from the NZTA website about the project.

The SH1 Avalon Drive Bypass will provide a new free flowing bypass road that will bypass the congested section of Avalon Drive from Rotokauri Road to Norton Road. 

The bypass road will be approximately two kilometres long and have roundabout intersections at each end. The project commences north of the existing intersection of Rotokauri Road with SH1, diverts to the east away from the existing highway by a roundabout intersection with the bypass running parallel to the railway along vacant ex-railway land. The bypass will pass over Forest Lake Road on a new overbridge that will be built alongside the existing railway overbridge. The bypass will then reconnect with the existing SH1 alignment at a new five-leg roundabout connecting with Norton Road, Lincoln Street and Rifle Range Road. Norton Road will be lowered to pass under a new railway bridge, which will replace the existing railway level crossing. 

The existing highway, which carries in excess of 25,000 vehicles per day, suffers from safety issues, congestion and delays, and environmental degradation through the adjacent residential and commercial areas along Avalon Drive (with a posted speed of 60km./h). There are significant delays at the two signalised intersections at Forest Lake Road and Norton Road, with the delays at Norton road compounded by the adjacent railway level crossing.

The intersection delays result in drivers taking short cuts through adjacent residential streets with consequent congestion and safety issues at minor intersections with local roads and the state highway.

A busy state highway passing through a built up urban area can constitute an increased safety risk for local inhabitants, degrade the environment of the community, and create a severance effect within the community.  It also impedes the passage of through traffic, increasing travel time and costs for people and freight.

The new bypass will initially be constructed as a two-lane route. However, provision has been made within the project’s current land designation for a further two lanes to be added as future traffic demand requires.</groundspeak:long_description>

Arthur Espie Porritt, Baron Porritt, Bt, GCMG, GCVO, CBE (10 August 1900 – 1 January 1994) was a New Zealand physician, military surgeon, statesman and athlete. He served as Governor-General of New Zealand between 1967 and 1972.

Early life
Porritt was born in Wanganui, New Zealand. His mother died in 1914 during his first year at the Wanganui Collegiate School, and his father left soon after to serve in World War I. He became a keen athlete. In 1920 he began studying towards a medical degree at the University of Otago where he was a resident at Selwyn College (Selwyn College, Otago). In 1923 Porritt was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, and he studied medicine from 1924 to 1926 at Magdalen College, Oxford.

 Sporting career
He represented New Zealand at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, France, winning a bronze medal in the 100 metre dash, the famed "Chariots of Fire" race; the winner was Harold Abrahams. The race took place at 7pm on 7 July 1924. Abrahams and Porritt dined together at 7pm on 7 July every year thereafter, until Abrahams' death. The race was later immortalised in the film Chariots of Fire, but due to Porritt’s modesty his name was changed to "Tom Watson".

He also won two heats in the 200 m, but came fifth in the semi-final. Porritt was captain of the New Zealand team at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, but withdrew from the 100 m because of injury.

After retirement from athletics Porritt was New Zealand's team manager at the 1934 British Empire Games in London and 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Porritt was the New Zealand member of the International Olympic Committee from 1934 to 1967. He was the first President of the IOC Medical Commission and served from 1961 to 1967.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;On the 3rd of November 1886 Henry Reynolds produced the first
butter here at the Pukekura Creamery. This was on the family farm
and on that 1st day they got 100lbs of butter from 400 cows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='http://img27.imageshack.us/i/pukekura.jpg/'&gt;&lt;img src='http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/508/pukekura.jpg'
     border='0' alt='Image Hosted by ImageShack.us' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the 1880s Reynolds and his partners had factories
thoughout the Waikato and Bay of Plenty and were exporting butter
to China Hong Kong and England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1893 it became part of the New Zealand Co Operative Dairy
Company (NZ Co-op DC). The company continued to grow and in 1939
had 36 suppliers and made 562,000lb of butter and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1961 the 40 suppliers made 1million pounds of butterfat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='http://img36.imageshack.us/i/factory.jpg/'&gt;&lt;img src='http://img36.imageshack.us/img36/3494/factory.jpg'
     border='0' alt='Image Hosted by ImageShack.us' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1975 this orginal factory closed as alot of smaller factories
amalgamated. The anchor symbol can still be seen on the end of the
building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='http://img4.imageshack.us/i/henryreynolds.jpg/'&gt;&lt;img src='http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/2987/henryreynolds.jpg'
     border='0' alt='Image Hosted by ImageShack.us' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anchor which is still a symbol on butter today was a tattoo
design that Henry Reynolds saw on the arm on one of his workers

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;tt&gt;In 1972 Moree NSW Australia's Mayor, Perry James,visited Te
Awamutu.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;It then had the same Postcode,2400 as did Moree
Township.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;The Mayor then invited the Te Awamutu Brass Band and the Te
Awamutu Pipe Band to attend the Moree A&amp;amp;P Show in
1974.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;These visits went ahead and encouraged more visits to
Moree.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;Moree is a similar sized town to Te Awamutu.&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;A twin town status was officially agreed on.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;At these coordinates above,a Monument was built.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;An enclosed waterproof street map cabinet was built into a
brick "L" shaped Monument.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;This was built and gifted by the then 'Waikato Dairy CO-OP
Ltd'.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;Constructed in 1984 and to celebrate 100 years of Local
Government.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Sam's Playground is an easy multi on a walk formed by the Cambridge Tree Trust and has been a favourite local place for us to get wet and scramble in the bush. 
Part of the walk heads through farmland although dogs are fine on a leash. Mind the electric fences - if you see cattle there is a good chance they will be powered. One of the places to rest along the way may be too final for some. 
Two (2) stages plus final cache.

The cache is 300ml container with logbook and pencil and room for small swaps.

&lt;p&gt;The final stage in the construction of a permanent Pontoon at
Lake Ngaroto was completed recently when this access ramp was
added.&lt;br /&gt;
After 40 years the rowers will no longer have to wade through muddy
water to launch their boats.&lt;br /&gt;
The Te Awamutu Rowing Club project began late last year.&lt;br /&gt;
It received support from the Waipa District Council and the local
business community,sponsorship from funding agencies,materials from
Timmo's ITM Building Centre and labour from Waikeria Prison.&lt;br /&gt;
Prison staff,inmates and rowing club members,joined forces to carry
out the installation.&lt;br /&gt;
The facility is to be blessed and officially opened early
October.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The public are also welcome to enjoy this facility,when the
rowers are not,that is.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Once again the logic of &lt;u&gt;children&lt;/u&gt; and their interpretation of
surroundings led to the creation of this cache.&lt;br /&gt;
Following the guidelines below will help you along your way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Best done in Daylight to appreciate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;If your GPSr drops reception,there is plenty of clear
areas.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start at the added Waypoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk the boardwalk,complete with the &lt;b&gt;"Rickety
Bridge".&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave the boardwalk and read &lt;b&gt;"The Sign".&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the &lt;b&gt;"Spooky Forest"&lt;/b&gt; and continue on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Come across a&lt;b&gt;" Large Tree"&lt;/b&gt; in the open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the &lt;b&gt;"Freaky Forest!"&lt;/b&gt; There is light at the
end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Into the" &lt;b&gt;Large Clearing"&lt;/b&gt;,head for the &lt;b&gt;"Row of
Trees".&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Into the &lt;b&gt;"Darkness"&lt;/b&gt; again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bridge number 1 &lt;b&gt;"Frog Chorus".&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bridge number 2 &lt;b&gt;"Mudover".&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bridge number 3 &lt;b&gt;"In a Clearing".&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bridge number 4 &lt;b&gt;"Just a bridge".&lt;/b&gt;turn left&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bridge number 5 &lt;b&gt;"Red Carpet".&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bridge number 6 &lt;b&gt;"Over it we go".&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">When Cambridge was founded in 1864 the east bank of the Waikato River was called Cambridge East and the west bank Cambridge West. 

When Cambridge West became a Town District in March 1908 the name Leamington was adopted. James Keeley (a driving force in public affairs) had come from Leamington Spa in England and put forward the suggestion.
A petition was circulated against the new name, why not rename it Karangi,  or Cambridge South - the true position; or Keeleyville.

It was decided to name all the streets after authors and poets - a practice still continued by Waipa District Council.  Such names as Shakespeare, Keats, and Arnold join more modern writers such as Hunt, Grace and Rowling.

December 1907 Victoria Bridge opened.
Aotearoa Meats started to build an abattoir on their Leamington site in 1965.  Now closed.
The Post Office opened in March 1968
About 6500 people live in Leamington (from the 2006 census).

An upgrade of the shopping area, known by the Waipa District Council as ‘Leamington Village’ was completed in September 2009.

A hint is contained in this quote from Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.

Shylock:
Go to then, you come to me, and you say,
"Shylock, we would have moneys," you say so. . . .
Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,
With bated breath and whisp'ring humbleness,
Say this:
"Fair sir, you spet on me Wednesday last,
You spurn'd me such a day, another time
You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies
I'll lend you thus much moneys"?</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Three Sisters is a rock formation, formerly consisting of three stacks, on the coast of northern Taranaki. One of the sisters has recently been toppled and only the base remains, giving us an excellent example of how our coastline is constantly changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stacks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stack is a geological landform consisting of a steep and often vertical column or columns of rock in the sea near a coast. Stacks are formed when part of a headland is eroded by hydraulic action, which is the force of the sea or water crashing against the rock. The force of the water weakens cracks in the headland, causing them to later collapse, forming free-standing stacks and even a small island. Stacks can provide important nesting locations for seabirds, and many are popular for rock climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the constant presence of water, stacks also form when a natural arch collapses under gravity, due to sub-aerial processes like wind erosion. A stack may collapse or be eroded, leaving a stump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stacks typically form in horizontally bedded sedimentary or volcanic rocks particularly on limestone cliffs, because of the medium resistance to erosion. A more resistant layer may form a capstone. Cliffs with weaker rock such as clay tend to slump and erode too quickly to form stacks, while harder rocks such as granite erode in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sea attacks small cracks and opens them. The cracks then gradually get larger and turn into a small cave. When the cave wears right through the headland, an arch forms. Further erosion causes the arch to collapse, leaving the pillar of hard rock standing away from the coast called a stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;source: wikipedia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This Earthcache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cliffs in front of you show evidence of the formation of new caves, which may result in the creation of new stacks and other interesting coastal features in the centuries and millenia to come. In fact, a new sister (not quite visible from this view point) is currently being formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To log a find on this earthcache you must visit the published coordinates during daylight. There you must:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Answer this question: How many sea caves can you count (from where you are standing) forming in the small island in front of you, and the cliff to the left (along the edge of the river estuary)?&lt;br /&gt;
2. Take a photo including yourself, your GPS, and The Three Sisters. Example photos are shown below. Do NOT give away the answer to the question above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for your online log to be valid, you must send the answer to the question above to the cache owner and you must upload the photo, clearly showing your GPS, with your online log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can log this cache straight away &lt;b&gt;after&lt;/b&gt; you have emailed your answers to the cache owner, no need to wait for confirmation. &lt;b&gt;Please include the name of this earthcache in the email&lt;/b&gt; - you'd be surprised how many people forget. Also, when contacting us with answers, &lt;b&gt;if you want a reply, please include your email address&lt;/b&gt;. Any problems with your answers we'll be in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/968f8445-9264-4993-bfa1-693752dc6dad.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HAPPY EARTHCACHING!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Please make sure you pay attention to the instructions as this one

&lt;b&gt;Things to note:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Children will not always be standing at the entrance or sign, they
have to go home occasionally to eat. If you want a lovely walk then
take the first left on the trail which takes you down some steps
and along the river past a waterfall.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Just to the left of a large stump on river side of the path, look straight up the hill at the small stump.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

In geography, confluence means the meeting of two or more waterways.&lt;br /&gt;
It usually means the point where a smaller river joins a more major river.&lt;br /&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;font face="Engravers MT"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;In 1830, Kaipaka, a pa near Otawhao, occupied by the Ngatihinetu and Ngatiapakura, was attacked by the Ngatihauas, Ngatikoroki, and Ngatiruru, who perpetrated an indiscriminate slaughter of men, women, and children.&lt;br /&gt;
The following anecdote was related to me by a woman who belonged to the assaulting party.&lt;br /&gt;
She had saved from drowning an infant that had been thrown into the creek (Mangapiko) which ran close to the pa.&lt;br /&gt;
On taking it from the water she had nestled it to her bosom to warm it and preserve its life if possible; the poor little thing unfortunately uttered a cry; a savage passing by heard it, and he immediately seized the child, tore it from her, notwithstanding her remonstrances, and deliberately stuck it up before the fire and roasted it alive.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1873 - St. John, J. H. A. Pakeha Rambles through Maori Lands.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is placed near to where this place marked the end of navigation by canoe on the Manga-o-hoi River, although it was possible to go much further down the Mangapiko River.&lt;br /&gt;
Here you will find the &lt;b&gt;confluence&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Mangapiko or Manga-Piko translates as meaning Crooked Waterway.&lt;br /&gt;
This very windy river winds its way westward to join the Waipa river near Pirongia.&lt;br /&gt;
This was,pre european times the number one highway into Kaipaka Pa.&lt;br /&gt;
This was the site of the town's first natural outdoor swimming pool,being the river itself.&lt;br /&gt;
Original tracks leading to the river,still remain today.&lt;br /&gt;
Somewhere about upon searching,you may find the remnants of an original springboard.&lt;br /&gt;
Across from here lies the site of the Kaipaka Pa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To locate the cache,find a sign in Christie Avenue at the above coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
Read the sign and note down the year mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;
The "year" mentioned will become &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;ABCD&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The maori word preceeding &lt;b&gt;Apakura&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Number of letters will equal &lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Checksum of ABCDE = 14&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;S 38 . 00 . A (E + 1) (A x 2)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;E 175. 1 (A + B).(A + 1) B B&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring a Pen or Pencil to complete the logsheet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache is a bit fiddly so allow the least chubbiest fingers to dismantle and reassmble&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif" border="0" align="middle" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">In 2009 I was a student at Hamilton Boys High School and I had to
do a research project. I chose geocaching. One of my questions was
"What is the 'ideal' geocache design?".</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I sent out a survey to 40 geocachers and here are the

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What type of geocache do you prefer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/8e13e3bd-7d98-4b5e-b5ee-d0f2cf33cda6.jpg" /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What items do you think are essential in a new
geocache?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/b35ff7d9-3522-4ec7-9b7c-2cc18fb21a88.jpg" /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What location do you prefer to place a cache?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/6a5aad27-619c-4705-98a5-91513b666f24.jpg" /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
According to my results, the 'ideal' cache would be a
&lt;b&gt;traditional&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;regular&lt;/b&gt;, a &lt;b&gt;clip-top container&lt;/b&gt;,
with a &lt;b&gt;log book&lt;/b&gt;, a &lt;b&gt;pencil&lt;/b&gt;, a &lt;b&gt;cache note&lt;/b&gt;, a
&lt;b&gt;pencil sharpener&lt;/b&gt; and some &lt;b&gt;swaps&lt;/b&gt; and is placed on a
&lt;b&gt;bush walk&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 As part of my research project, and as a conclusion to "What is
the 'ideal' geocache design?", I have placed an 'ideal' geocache at
the Taitua Abroretum. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 The Taitua Arboretum covers 20 hectares of trees and open pasture
with 2.3 kilometres of easy grade walkways. In 1997 the Taitua
Arboretum was gifted to the Hamilton City Council by John and Bunny
Mortimer to ensure its sound management and continued development
for the benefit of the community.&lt;br /&gt;
The Mortimers began planting trees at Taitua in 1973. Today there
are more than 1500 species of idigenous and exotic trees and
shrubs.&lt;br /&gt;
The overall collection of trees provides a mix of open and wooded
areas and contains unusual and rare species of trees and shrubs
growing in a variety of soil types and terrains.&lt;br /&gt;
The Hamilton City Council continues the vision of the Mortimers and
is continuing in developing the Arboretum as a recreational and
educational assett for the inspiration and enjoyment of the
community.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Open 7 days from 8am to half an hour before dusk. Admission
free.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is not the first cache at the Taitua Arboretum, the other
cache is
&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=f339ae5e-f41b-4acf-8665-b864dad51361"&gt;
Taitua Arbo... what? (Waikato)&lt;/a&gt; . If you have not done this
cache, add it to your list for an extended walk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a green 2l sistema clip-top container.&lt;br /&gt;
When the cache was hidden it contained the following swaps:&lt;br /&gt;
HBHS Bookmark&lt;br /&gt;

the Waipa and Waikato Rivers meet. While there are two Maori

is a very informative sign not far from the cache which gives the
history of the area and “The Point.” &lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">So, you&amp;rsquo;ve done your homework by completing the other two
caches in our "Rotund - As..." series? Then you&amp;rsquo;ve come to
the right place for your bonus mystery cache!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;To solve this cache you will have needed to go to the other two
caches in our "Rotund - As..." series and obtain the clue in the
cache as well as the year it was built.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Please note that the clues at the other two caches have been
updated as of 7th January 2011 so you may need to check on these if
done previously.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Leamington Rotunda stands in the Leamington Domain and is
unique in that it is an octagonal two storied rotunda. The building
celebrated its one hundredth birthday on the 25th May 2010. The
bottom level is a sports pavilion while the top story is the
bandstand. It has been relocated twice and now resides in its
current location where it was moved in 1992. (It narrowly avoided
becoming extinct in 1983 when it was suggested the bottom story be
demolished!) The rotunda is made from Kauri and Totara, with
ornamental iron friezes and was designed by architect Chas Reid,
while being built by William Hogan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The given coordinates are for a waypoint which holds directions
for&lt;br /&gt;
solving the clues obtained at the other two caches for the
final.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The bonus is within 1km of the waypoint - there's no rotunda here
but we think it would be a good site - what do you think?!&lt;br /&gt;

There is a track starting near the stream which will take you to the cache, if you lose it, it's OK, the area is harmless apart from a few wasps/bees on warmer days. Please hide the cache well afterwards as children often go up there.
The beach is wonderful in summer, with the black sand getting real hot. Feel free to swim in the river, but not near the heads or in the sea.

The Heads is the furthest point you can normally go when the tide is up, but if the tide is going out or just turned to come in, I recommend the walk past the heads 1.1kms to a beach called Willisons with a “small” pool to swim in. Just keep walking, you will go through a “trench”, across some rocks, and around a bay. You will know when you get to Willisons!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Henry Hinton was born at Castle Combe (Whiltshire, England) on 20th August, 1828. He arrived in Australia with his wife Sarah and his first child in 1849. Henry then travelled to New Zealand with his family of now seven children, and his wife, in 1864. After 27 days of rough passage, they finally arrived in Auckland. Henry as a member of NO.4 Co.4th Waikato Regiment Advanced Party, landed at Hamilton on the 24th August, 1864.

The land where the cache is hidden was once part of Henry's 60 acre farm section.

The cache is a 300ml sistema which contains:

- Log book
- Pencil
- And trades

FTF - ???

This is my first cache and i had some troubles with muggles whilst trying to place the cache. 

The Cache is a small see through container containing a log book, pens and other small items. Please do trade.

Overall easy find though the ground can get quite damp at times.

However, many cachers live in the area so if you feel as though you’re being watched - you very well may be. 

A good cache for the kids to find. Please put cache back as found.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">An EarthCache featuring the &lt;b&gt;Mangapohue Oyster Beds.&lt;/b&gt; 35
million years ago this whole area was under water. This cache will
take you to a limestone outcrop where the fossilised oysters can be
clearly seen present in the rock.
&lt;p&gt;You will need to answer a number of questions to complete the
requirements of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Parking is at S 38° 15.682 E 174° 53.940
&lt;p&gt;35 million years ago these oysters lived, as you would expect,
in the sea. Yet today they are now 17 kilometres from the sea. Once
this whole area lay under sea. All these years ago, large parts of
the King Country and Waitomo area as far south west as Awakino and
south east to Benneydale were under water. The picture below shows
the location of the oyster beds in relation to the present day
coastlines and towns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/331ad4b3-6f01-445f-bade-2591bd6373e9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coastline was wild and wind swept with huge beds of oysters.
Gradually sediment and shell fragments smothered the beds
compacting to form limestone. About 10 million years ago, movement
in the earths crust caused the sea floor (along with the limestone
encrusted oyster beds) to rise and become land. In places wind and
water have eroded the limestone and exposed the oysters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo below shows the limestone with the oysters clearly
visible. The giant oysters are likely to be &lt;b&gt;Flemingostrea
wollastoni.&lt;/b&gt; Similar giant oysters were found beneath the
limestone at Port Waikato. In addition to the oysters, others chips
of barnacles, bryozoans, bivalves, and some red algal grains were
also found in the limestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/9831c600-4b35-4cc1-9459-d424255769d1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These oysters can also be viewed in the Piripiri Caves which are
4km further on from the Natural Bridge. These caves are not guided
so you will need a torch, good boots, and mud-proof clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To log this EarthCache, you must answer the following and
email us the results:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please wait until you have received the
okay from us before logging your find.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The published co-ords will take you to an information sign.
What is the altitude here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Directly ahead of the sign and approximately 6 metres away is
an excellent example of an oyster encrusted in the limestone.
Describe the size of this oyster.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">No Bush Bashing required for this one. Originally a CD only swap cache, but that was muggled, so it has been replaced with a smaller one.
NZ, Aotearoa, is "the land of the long white cloud"
Pukekohe birds breed in the area, amazing to see them "walking on water".</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Bowl of Brooklands is a popular outdoor concert venue.Previous acts include Sir Elton John, Jack Johnson, R.E.M., Santana, UB40, Michael Crawford, Stevie Nicks, John Farnham, Mark Knopfler, The Doobie Brothers, World of Music Arts and Dance (WOMAD), Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Sir Cliff Richard, Split Enz, New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and the Royal New Zealand Ballet.
 The Festival of Lights over the summer makes a night time visit almost compulsory.
Free concerts almost every night , in Pukekura Park , where else in the world would you want to be?
The cache may not be available while a concert is on unless you have tickets.
A popular place even for muggles.

Tree cover affects the GPs readings, I took 4 all different , this one seems the closest.

Original Contents, about 7 cd's , some are doubles.
One even has a good number of the Artists who have been here.</groundspeak:long_description>

Ideal first spot for the young kids to play. 

At the first two you will find coordinates to the next, no tricky puzzles, pretty straight forward. 
After the park follow the track down the hill and over the bridge. 

Keep an eye on small children from here, there is a small stream beside that turns into a slightly bigger stream at final. 
Final is big enough to fit geocoins, small trackables and swaps. I will try to get a couple more going from here soon. 

Contents on placement: Log book, baby badge pin, small compass, keyring money, lip balm, note.  FTF contact me.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sir Barnes Neville Wallis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(26 September 1887 &amp;ndash; 30 October 1979)&lt;br /&gt;
An English scientist, engineer and inventor.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/cd69a62c-cb0a-444d-8f68-6857898e637a.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wallis had envisaged the Allies using a huge bomb against the
Germans &amp;ndash; ten tons in weight so that any building/object was
vulnerable to an aerial attack even if it was built
underground.&lt;br /&gt;
This fifty-page piece of work stated that the Allies had to develop
a new form of bombing if massive concrete structures were to be
destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;
He wanted much larger bombs built so that the area surrounding
where the bombs were dropped would be so massively shaken as to
create enough jarring pressure to shake a target to pieces.&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore, pinpoint precision bombing would no longer be necessary
as physics would take over once a bomb had exploded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallis proved that a 10 ton bomb dropped at 40,000 feet would go
135 feet into a normal surface and would create no crater as all
energy would be directed into an earthquake effect with potentially
devastating consequences.&lt;br /&gt;
However, no one was particularly interested in what Wallis had
written and many felt that his ideas were just
&amp;lsquo;pie-in-the-sky&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
No one had ever built a bomb that was 10 tons; no bomber had ever
been built that could carry such a bomb and no plane flying then
could fly at 40,000 feet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Some saw Wallis as an eccentric&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
However, one part of his paper did attract attention.&lt;br /&gt;
Wallis believed that Germany&amp;rsquo;s industrial heart could be
destroyed &amp;ndash; literally drowned &amp;ndash; if the huge dams in the
Ruhr were destroyed unleashing vast quantities of water into the
Ruhr industrial sector.&lt;br /&gt;
An &amp;lsquo;Air Attack on Dams Committee&amp;rsquo; was formed in 1941
under the chairmanship Dr. Pye.&lt;br /&gt;
The committee decided that the primary target should be the Möhne
Dam which enclosed the Möhne and Hedve rivers.&lt;br /&gt;
The dam was 130 feet high and 112 feet thick at its base.&lt;br /&gt;
Even the top was 25 feet thick making it a formidable target to
destroy.&lt;br /&gt;
The first idea Wallis had was to attack the dam with a series of
very large bombs in a conventional manner.&lt;br /&gt;
He quickly dropped this idea as the accuracy required for such an
aerial attack was simply beyond the capacity for a bomb aimer at
several thousand feet.&lt;br /&gt;
A bomb would need to land within 50 feet of the dam&amp;rsquo;s wall
for it to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Wallis was not easily put off.&lt;br /&gt;
Wallis was keen on the idea of getting an explosive charge as near
to the wall of the dam as was possible.&lt;br /&gt;
Wallis believed that if this could be done on the lakeside of the
dam, the vast pressure applied to that side of the damaged wall
would be enough to destroy the dam itself.&lt;br /&gt;
A torpedo type bomb was out of the question as the Germans had
already thought of that as a way of attacking the dam.&lt;br /&gt;
Anti-torpedo nets protected the dam.&lt;br /&gt;
Wallis came up with an idea he called "childishly simple".&lt;br /&gt;
He believed that you could use a bouncing bomb that would clear the
protective nets, that would smash into the dam wall, stay intact
and then sink to a depth of 30 feet before exploding using a
hydrostatic fuse (similar to the ones found in depth
charges).&lt;br /&gt;
To ensure that the bomb went down the dam wall, Wallis planned for
the bomb to spin forwards after it had hit the wall &amp;ndash; despite
the fact that it would be dropped by a bomber spinning
backwards.&lt;br /&gt;
Wallis received permission to develop the bomb &amp;ndash; code-named
&lt;b&gt;"Upkeep"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The bomb was 50 inches in diameter, 60 inches long and weighed 9250
lbs.&lt;br /&gt;
Of this weight, 6,600 lbs was powerful RDX explosive.&lt;br /&gt;
The bomb was designed to be mounted across the bomb bay of a
Lancaster bomber.&lt;br /&gt;
It was spun using a system of V-shaped pivots to which was attached
a small motor built into the bomb bay.&lt;br /&gt;
Upkeep was not an easy bomb to deliver and the elite of Bomber
Command joined a brand new squadron called 617 in March 1943.&lt;br /&gt;
The crew had to release the bomb while flying at exactly 220 mph
and at a height of exactly 60 feet above the water.&lt;br /&gt;
If the Lancaster was forced into a tight turn at this height, one
of its wing tips would barely be above the surface of the
water.&lt;br /&gt;
Precision flying at its best was needed just to get the bomb in
motion.&lt;br /&gt;
To add to the difficulties, the crew had to drop the bomb at
exactly 425 yards from the dam wall.&lt;br /&gt;
There could only be 25 yards either side of this figure &amp;ndash; a
tiny amount of seconds given the speed the Lancaster's would be
flying at &amp;ndash; and the fact that German guns would be targeting
them.&lt;br /&gt;
To add to the task, the attack was also scheduled to be carried out
at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole attack was given the code-name
&lt;b&gt;"Chastise"&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Gibson was ordered by &amp;lsquo;Bomber&amp;rsquo; Harris, head of Bomber
Command, to pick men who had survived near enough 60 bombing raids
as these men would have the necessary experience needed for the
attack.&lt;br /&gt;
617 squadron started extensive sessions of low flying but none of
them knew the target they were practising for &amp;ndash; this they
were only told at the last minute.&lt;br /&gt;
On the night of May 16th, 1943, nineteen Lancaster bombers took off
from Scampton in Lincolnshire.&lt;br /&gt;
They had three primary targets: the Möhne, Eder and Sorpe dams and
two secondary ones, the Lister and the Eneppe dams.&lt;br /&gt;
Of the nineteen planes, five would be held in reserve during the
attacks.&lt;br /&gt;
Gibson led the first attack. At 00.56 hours, the Möhne Dam was
breached and by 01.54 hours so was the Eder Dam.&lt;br /&gt;
The Sorpe Dam was attacked by planes from the reserve force but,
though hit, it held out.&lt;br /&gt;
Just how low the Lancasters flew during the attack is shown by the
fact that one Lancaster had to turn back as it had hit the sea on
the journey to mainland Europe and lost its bomb.&lt;br /&gt;
The attack had huge propaganda value and made Gibson a national
hero.&lt;br /&gt;
Of the nineteen Lancasters that took part in the attacks with 133
crew, eight planes were lost with the loss of 56 men; three of
these men survived to become prisoners-of-war.&lt;br /&gt;
Gibson was awarded the Victoria Cross for bringing round his
Lancaster to give covering fire to the Lancasters that were
following up his attack on the Möhne Dam.&lt;br /&gt;
33 others members of 617 squadron were also decorated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A scientist has suggested developing a bomb which will bounce
on water when travelling transverse to the water surface at high
speed.&lt;br /&gt;
It has been suggested that this bouncing bomb will enable the
target to be struck more centrally whilst releasing it from a
greater distance.&lt;br /&gt;
Several scientists have tried to calculate the height h of the
bouncing bomb above sea level at the point at which it will be
level with the wall after the first bounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img src=

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The scientists agree on the overall general form of the
equation but cannot agree on some of the signs and which way around
some of the factors should go.&lt;br /&gt;
Although the best option was with planes involved in the
field&lt;br /&gt;
Experimenting with field results came up with too many variables
though&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To reveal the cache coordinates solve this equation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;South 37º AH . WK (L-Y)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;East 175º (L-K)(H-3) .(W-Y+1) (P+2)(W+Y-1)&lt;/h2&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is the site of the now derelict Tokanui Hospital.
I used to work at this hospital as a Registered Nurse from Feb 1984 through Dec 1997. I then moved to the new facility at Waikato Hospital the Henry Rongomau Bennett Centre in recognition of the ex Superintendant of Tokanui from 1964-1984. Dr H R Bennett.

It actually closed down in Dec 1998 after the last of the Psychopaedic patients was moved to Community Care.

Tokanui Hospital is one of the old Asylum like hospitals as was Carrington in Auckland, Oakley in Auckland, Kingseat in South Auckland,  Porirua in Wellington, Sunnyside in ChCH and Cherry farm and Seacliffe  both near Dunedin.
Tokanui opened in July 1912 with a trainload of patients dropped off at the main trunk railway line down the rd at Te Mawhai.
It was self sufficient for many years and ran as a farm, with its own butcher shop etc.
In the 1980's it was at the forefront in mental health as it had the first Cultural Unit within a Psychiatric facility in New Zealand. Called "Whai Ora". It also had a Therapeutic Community running as well as the general admission wards and long stay wards.

Due to the "Deinstitutionalisation" Phiosophy a lot of these "remote" places were closed down and the care of the Mentally Ill was transferred to smaller units in the general hospital facilities.
In its heyday Tokanui would have had 1200 plus residents.
It was segregated also untill the late 70's early 80's.
The site is now run by the local Maniopoto Iwi who the land was taken from originally.
The nearby Settlement houses are rented out.
A book is being produced on the History of Tokanui and should be released on the 100th Anniversary year being 2012.

&lt;b&gt;Maybe you're saying, like some others out there in the Hamilton
Caching Community......No More Puzzles!! ....Down with
Puzzles!!....We don't like Puzzles!!...Puzzles are too hard!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So......Welcome to Geckoh's Easy Peasy Puzzle Series! This series
will not only be easy peasy for the most puzzle challenged amongst
you but may even be a little fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And with solving the puzzle and making the find, there is even an
extra special bonus (beyond that warm glowing feeling you gain from
solving a puzzle) and that is each puzzle has written in the
logbook part of the code for the bonus puzzle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But wait.. there's more.. you will also get a hint for one of our
other harder puzzles. By the end of the series you should have no
cause to grumble that you can't solve some of the local
puzzles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ok, for this puzzle cache we are going to use rhyming words and
simple mathematics &amp;ndash; just add up the letters and voila
&amp;hellip; you will have your co-ordinates:-&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="red" size="+3"&gt;The Co-ords are:&lt;br /&gt;
S 37 AB.CDE&lt;br /&gt;
E 175 VW.XYZ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#660066"&gt;A =
CASH&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
B = CACHE&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
C = SPLASH&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
D = ASH (-1)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
E = HASH&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
V = DASH (-3)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
W = MASH&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
X = FLASH (-4)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Y = PANACHE (+2)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Z = CRASH (-2)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do you really need a geochecker?? Ok, fine, use the
geochecker if you want to.. or you could ask a five year old to
check your answers!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=
"http://geotjek.dk/geo_inputchkcoord.php?gid=4521789f27ea0-3cf9-4588-abf5-d465cbb291f9"&gt;
Check your solution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=
"http://geocheck.org/geo_inputchkcoord.php?gid=4521789f27ea0-3cf9-4588-abf5-d465cbb291f9"&gt;
&lt;img src=

title="Check your solution" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now off you go, quick find the puzzle&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;And remember google is your
friend!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Note: Although this puzzle series is easy enough for a child,
the areas where the caches are hidden are not necessarily
child-friendly areas. Please watch the kiddly winkies!!&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Note : The original Mountain track on which this cache was placed has now been closed and to access this cache now you will have to take the new Track..Just follow from the carpark...When you get to the summit tower you will need to travel down the original track to access cache site following DOC markers which still remain.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Look for the Split Tree:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When you get to the Split tree &lt;font color="red"&gt;STOP.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Pace back 5 metres and look up to the right.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is down track of split tree where you would leave the track.&lt;br /&gt;
You will see a large rock off in the bush.&lt;br /&gt;
Head for that rock.&lt;br /&gt;
Now proceed up all the large rocks to GZ.&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is at base of uppermost large rock.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">XC and TK usually travel highway 1B on way south to Turangi to avoid Hamilton metropolis ...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
XC thought it was about time that Hautapu had a quickstop cache... and has been wondering where would be a good place. Hmmm this looks like a good spot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Always a good excuse to stop and pick up an easy drive by and stretch your legs at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a vitamin tube in a TK camo coat with log and room for&lt;br /&gt;
small items only.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Traffic gets busy at times but you can park on the grass verge well off the road.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please replace cache as you find it. Or if in the open it has likely been pushed out by a resident rodent or rabbit.. Mind your fingers.... and return it to the obvious hiding place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Series&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

175° 43.156&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;center&gt;&lt;font face="CAC Moose" size="+0.5"&gt;&lt;font color=
"red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is NOT at the&lt;br /&gt;
listed co-ordinates,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
but it is within 5km.&lt;br /&gt;
But those with a magic ink reader should be able to source the
final....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="CAC Moose" size="+5"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ok, so you have completed all the other Easy Peasy Puzzles (and
you are secretly starting to enjoy solving puzzles, go on admit
it!) so its time for the Bonus Cache! Again, its pretty easy peasy
- you only needed to have collected the required numbers from the
previous caches in the series and do a simple maths equation
(below)and you are off to claim the final cache!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And as previously mention this cache too holds a bonus clue for one
of our other harder puzzles. Now you should no longer have any
cause to grumble that you can't solve some of the local puzzles
(but if you are still struggling, feel free to email us with your
workings and we are happy to guide you in the right
direction).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Puzzle updated due to untimely demise of 'I See Red' Cache!&lt;br /&gt;
13 Dec 2010 updated due to demise of Its only Natural......&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;Ok so here is your Equation:-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font face="CAC Moose" size="+0.5"&gt;&lt;font color="#009900"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
S 38 (4-4) (2+1) . (L X W-2)&lt;br /&gt;
E 175 (44-40) (9/3) . (D X 12+(M X 2)+10)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do you really need a geochecker?? Ok, fine, use the
geochecker if you want to.....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now off you go, quick find the puzzle&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Bring along your Oregon, Dakota, 78s or 62s, go to setup&gt;geocaching and switch on the “Chirp Scanning” then go to the published waypoint…..  The rest will be revealed!
Make sure you have all fitness device scanning off, or the chirp scanning will be unreliable.

Enjoy a wander in a little tramped reserve area while you search.

Remember there is nothing to be found at the published point, but if you don’t have the required device, crack the hint – there is some more info there for you…

A Parking waypoint is included, DO NOT TRY TO APPROACH FROM THE BUSY COBHAM DRIVE HIGHWAY.

Even if the gate at the parking waypoint is open, I suggest you walk, as the budding William Tell’s in the park will lock it when they leave.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>You will be chirped a hint for the final.

For those without the GPS models, try this:
The cache is two zero two metres from the Superintendents Secret, three six nine metres from Hayes Paddock and two eight two metres from the listed location of Henry Rongomau Bennett Centre.

&lt;p&gt;'Ara' means path and 'puni' means either blocked up or campsite.
The meaning may be either "pathway to the campsite" or "a path
blocked by some obstruction".&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An exercise in waypoint projection and skill.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you reveal the campsite area?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start at the posted coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a cache here with the coordinates within for next stage
"Ara"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note these coordinates down and return into cache and rehide
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find "Ara" to find "Puni".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ara" and "Puni" contain extra important information to
note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not take waypoint notes inside caches with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please rehide all stages well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to find "Ara" and "Puni" and put the 2 together to find
the Campsite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you will find a 500ml container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camo coated..please cover well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">DIDO (West)
I stole this idea for a cache from the Aussies.
The name stands for  Drive In  Drive Out and as the name suggests the caches are small, (read micro) and easy to access, so it is really a drive by and helps add to your numbers if that’s what caching is to you.
Often the area is a layby into or out of a town/city, or maybe an area of interest such as a lookout.
For this reason they are mostly high muggle areas so some stealth is required.
There are four caches roughly equating to the points of the compass giving you a trip around the lake. 
All are magnetic Ecllipse tins.
Drive across the road to the gravel area for safety if you are travelling south.
Please don't move the cache to the end of the barrier. It is where it is for the safety of cachers and motorists travelling north.
Cache is Invisible at 0 metres.</groundspeak:long_description>

Hora Hora School is a small, rural, full primary school 20 minutes south-east of Cambridge. It is nestled in the foothills of Maungatautari mountain and just 5 minutes from the upper reaches of Lake Karapiro.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The school first opened in 1909 and they have commerated a few important anniversaries since then!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This multi takes you on a short journey through the celebrated history of the school. It can be done on foot and there should be plenty of parking.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Note that during school hours it will be pretty much impossible, best to keep this to evenings and weekends please.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A little bit of History.

History of St Andrews Golf Course, Hamilton. St Andrews of Hamilton was founded in 1903, and over the first 10 years had three different homes on nine-hole courses.

In 1910, H T Gillies, a scratch golfer and local lawyer, purchased the present property. It was great links style country and with the help of NZ Amateur Champion Arthur Duncan of Wellington, he developed the layout.

By 1913 the course was ready for play. He named it St Andrews, and the Club has played on the course since it's opening in April 1913.

While originally an inland links style course, today it is a picturesque course, with some holes bordering the mighty Waikato River. This gives the St Andrews course a very tranquil and relaxed setting. None more so the challenging par 5 fourth hole. The short dogleg gives the player many options on the drive and second shot, but the river is always lurking to catch the wayward shot.

The signature hole would have to be the par 3 18th. While protected by bunkers surrounding the green that catch any shot lacking in direction and distance, it's the 2 metre deep front bunker that's most intimidating. 
St Andrews of Hamilton has proudly hosted many top amateur &amp; professional events, including the

NZ Open Championship – 1920, 1927, 1937, 1958, 1975
NZ Men's Amateur – 1920, 1927, 1937, 1958, 1964, 1994
NZ Women's Amateur – 1947 &amp; 1957
NZ Men's Inter-Provincial Teams Championships – 1983 &amp; 1999
NZ Women's Inter-Provincial Championship – 1965
Women's Commonwealth Tournament – 1971
North Island Men's Amateur Championship – 1948 &amp; 2004

There may be a black pearl at world's end hidden in a dead man's chest.  Take the stranger tides and discover a pirate's treasure. 
1. To find the exact co-ordinates you must find the years the 4 pirate movies were released. (last movie not released when this cache published, but assumed it must be this year, surely).
Divide each year by pieces of eight.  What do 3 of the 4 have in common?

S37 49.???

2. The movie: The Black ___ how many letters?

The movie: Deadman's ___ how many letters?

__ __ times pieces of eight plus the seven seas

E175 16.???

Now point your compass NW and navigate to the second tree from the iron H.


This is a themed cache which includes old and foreign coins, please maintain this theme when making swaps.

Extreme care of muggles: next to houses, there was a nosey neighbour when cache was placed, next to a park and school, so choose your timing well.</groundspeak:long_description>

Fanny (Phyllis Calvert) finishes at boarding school and returns to London, where she witnesses Lord Manderstoke (James Mason) fight and kill her supposed father. She soon learns that her family has run a brothel next door to her home and (on her mother's death) that he was not her real father. She goes to meet her real father - a respected politician - and falls in love with Harry Somerford (Stewart Granger), his advisor. Manderstoke continues to thwart her happiness.

The location of the 1 litre Camoed cache will become obvious on arrival.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="+1" color="burgandy"&gt;Cache is located by the two large Penstocks at Tauranga's Ruahihi Power Station. The building of the Ruahihi Power Station started in 1977 and was commissioned in May 1981. The Power Station gets feed water from Lake McLaren via 3.5kms of canal. The two large Penstocks you can see from the Cache location are 2.3 meters in diameter and 150 meters long. The water flows through these Penstocks to two 10,000 kW Turbines. The Ruahihi Power Station generates 70,000,000 kW of power each year for the Tauranga region..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="+1" color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;Cache is a 1.6 Litre round container painted black.&lt;br /&gt;
Cache contains log book, pencil and lots of goodies for the kids.&lt;br /&gt;
Please rehide well when placing cache back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="+1" color="orange"&gt;Please be very careful around this road as it is very busy. Please also be careful getting to the cache location as there is the odd bit of gorse around. Please access the cache location from up the hill a bit and not straight from the car park as there is a ditch that may be hard to see if caching at night.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Year 2000 - first geocaches hidden - large buckets with lids&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Guess we should call these first generation caches!&lt;br /&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;
2nd Generation caches - Large used ammo cans, watersealed, hidden somewhere that required a hike (tramp) to, a real bushman's cache!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3rd Generation caches - Plastic containers, push-on lids,or takeaway meal plastic boxes, hidden in scenic spots, not such a significant walk required - about year 2002&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4th Generation caches - Those now famous click-clack or sistema caches, getting smaller - only 2 litre in size, followed quickly by the smaller 1 litre.&lt;br /&gt;
About 2005 - These were now being found in urban areas too!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5th Generation caches - Getting smaller - down to 400ml, and in cities and town parks. Even a few in playgrounds!&lt;br /&gt;
About 2006&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
6th Generation caches - the urban MICRO! Hated by some, loved by others as it opened up more spaces; Magnets became popular.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
7th Generation caches - Loathe them or hate them - the NANO! Held on mainly by magnets, so you knew where to look, unless some hider made it harder by adding a nail somewhere non-magnetic&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
8th Generation caches ........ well, what will the future bring - the electronic cache?&lt;br /&gt;
But not virtuals.... they are a thing of the past! Experienced cachers will remember them.... Just visit a spot and answer a question.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
oh, and I must mention - the puzzle war generation..... where the cache is a puzzle to solve, with competition between solvers.&lt;br /&gt;
Final placement may be themed along with the puzzle, but often is not.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many new players find only micro and nano caches in their first few weeks, or even months of joining in this game..... so when they go to hide a cache, it too is a micro!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I've found a secret trail and I've hidden an ammo can for you to find......&lt;br /&gt;
It might just be the BIGGEST cache new cachers have ever found!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font size="4" face="Tahoma" color="#CC0033"&gt;But, it seems I've forgotten to leave a pencil - sorry, folks - please bring your own!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Tahoma" color="#CC0033"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background:yellow;"&gt;And please - once you've found it, NO spoiler comments please - difficulty is correctly listed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Margin of error was high at dusk, when placed - so it all adds to the difficulty! hee hee!&lt;br /&gt;
Required lots of waypoint averaging, checking with "go to" function, more waypoints, checking etc.....&lt;br /&gt;
If you are approaching from the correct direction it will be on your right (not wrong) side! Stick to the track and you should have little difficulty finding it!&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Fairfield Park is a large sports park in the suburb of Fairfield. The Park has a hall on it which was originally built with thought to it becoming a gym.  While this did not eventuate it is now serving its purpose as a community centre.  The park has many links to the surrounding neighbourhood and is located next to Fairfield Primary School with the skate park and the playgrounds around the park providing great entertainment for school kids outside of classroom hours.  The park has good green space links across the suburb of Fairfield towards the Waikato River with an access to Caro Park located across Heaphy Terrace.

Te Whare o te Ata Community House borders Fairfield Park near the Northwest corner, and was established in 1986 to support and affirm the Fairfield/Chartwell Community. It is a large house with open plan lounge, dinning and kitchen area that is suitable for up to 20 people.

Regular activities include a vege garden, social English classes, tattoo removal, monthly Okapu wananga, Community Living Trust cooking, drama and marae skills classes, computer club, and several regular hires.

Geocachers are also welcome to pop in for a cup of coffee or use our computer suite when the house is open. We're very friendly!</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;My first Puzzle Cache, nice and simple I hope with more to come over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are fortunate here in Hamilton with first rate institutions for learning that prepare our children and young adults for a future in the world where they will hopefully have the will and desire to succeed in their chosen profession or trade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A simple cache in a quiet spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woodlands was a 98,000 acre estate purchased from the Crown in 1872. It was one of the largest private reclamation projects of its time, transforming the colonial landscape through land drainage. It is valuable for demonstrating the scale and ambition of agricultural expansion in late nineteenth-century New Zealand, particularly in the Waikato region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the scale of the job, we are looking at an area covering from Gordonton, to Taupiri, outskirts of both Morrinsville and Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Waikato much of what we now consider to be prime farmland was broken in to pasture by soldiers returning from wars both locally and overseas. In 1928 Don &amp;amp; Irene Riddell took up residence at Woodlands and were the last private owners of what is now a nationally treasured historic estate and gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/a2208d52-c4fb-4d76-b400-66e2425c4fe8.jpg" align="right" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a place to remember those that have come before, worked hard and left so much in their passing. While you are here please take the time to look around and try to imagine the effort that past generations have put in to achieve what we have today. You will find Don &amp;amp; Irene Riddell along with L-Corp J Riddell (who died at Gallipoli) resting where they still call home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take the time to visit &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=fd2b106f-3eb4-4a54-97ae-7f3926904ee3"&gt;GC2TY40&lt;/a&gt; Woodlands (Waikato) to see part of what was created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs Dragon has been the inspiration for this cache&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations on FTF for ABCDF4 with a close second to eyespyben&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A band out of Sweden, Europe, had a song released in May 1986 written by Joey Tempest. This quickly became an anthem of its time. It became the bands most recognisable song that led it to make “Billboard’s Top 100” Rock Anthems of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it made #1 in 8 countries it was held out of the top spot here in New Zealand by “Cliff Richard and The Young Ones” with “Living Doll”. New Zealand what were we thinking!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Final "_______________" as you leave Hamilton heading north. Be very wary of both muggles, traffic and please watch those kidlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safe parking close by if you choose the right side.&lt;/p&gt;

If you were a Kiwi (a New Zealander) you may be familiar with the story of &lt;font size="2" face="arial" color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;“How Kiwi lost his Wings”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; , if not please take a moment to read the following Maori legend. It also refers to the unique appearance and nature of a variety of New Zealand native birds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is even a town in New Zealand that pays Homage to our national icon “The Kiwi”. Otorohanga is a rural town, south of Hamilton, dedicated to ensuring that everyone who passes through knows about the Kiwi and New Zealand icons (Kiwiana).&lt;/p&gt;
Please enjoy the story, the Geocache and the surrounding area.&lt;br /&gt;
The visit to the nearby attraction is well worth the effort, and any kids, young or old, will find it fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;
At the end of the story you will find a link that shows how kiwi’s fly, enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How “Kiwi” Lost his Wings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One day, Tanemahuta was walking through the forest. He looked up at his children reaching for the sky and he noticed that they were starting to sicken, as bugs were eating them.&lt;br /&gt;
He talked to his brother, Tanehokahoka, who called all of his children, the birds of the air together.&lt;br /&gt;
Tanemahuta spoke to them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"Something is eating my children, the trees. I need one of you to come down from the forest roof and live on the floor, so that my children can be saved, and your home can be saved. Who will come?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt; All was quiet, and not a bird spoke.&lt;br /&gt;
Tanehokahoka turned to Tui.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"E Tui, will you come down from the forest roof?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Tui looked up at the trees and saw the sun filtering through the leaves. Tui looked down at the forest floor and saw the cold, dark earth and shuddered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"Kao, Tanehokahoka, for it is too dark and I am afraid of the dark."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tanehokahoka turned to Pukeko.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"Pukeko, will you come down from the forest roof?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Pukeko looked down at the forest floor and saw the cold, damp earth and shuddered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"Kao, Tanehokahoka, for it is too damp and I do not want to get my feet wet."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt; All was quiet, and not a bird spoke.&lt;br /&gt;
Tanehokahoka turned to Pipiwharauroa.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"Pipiwharauroa, will you come down from the forest roof?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Pipiwharauroa looked up at the trees and saw the sun filtering through the leaves. Pipiwharauroa looked around and saw his family.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"Kao, Tanehokahoka, for I am busy at the moment building my nest."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt; All was quiet, and not a bird spoke. And great was the sadness in the heart of Tanehokahoka, for he knew, that if one of his children did not come down from the forest roof, not only would his brother loose his children, but the birds would have no home.&lt;br /&gt;
Tanehokahoka turned to Kiwi.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"E kiwi, will you come down from the forest roof?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Kiwi looked up at the trees and saw the sun filtering through the leaves. Kiwi looked around and saw his family. Kiwi looked at the cold damp earth. Looking around once more, he turned to&lt;br /&gt;
Tanehokahoka and said,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"I will."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Great was the joy in the hearts of Tanehokahoka and Tanemahuta, for this little bird was giving them hope. But Tanemahuta felt that he should warn kiwi of what would happen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"E kiwi, do you realise that if you do this, you will have to grow thick, strong legs so that you can rip apart the logs on the ground and you will loose your beautiful coloured feathers and wings so that you will never be able to return to the forest roof. You will never see the light on day again."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt; All was quiet, and not a bird spoke.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"E kiwi, will you come down from the forest roof?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Kiwi took one last look at the sun filtering through the trees and said a silent goodbye. Kiwi took one last look at the other birds, their wings and their coloured feathers and said a silent goodbye.&lt;br /&gt;
Looking around once more, he turned to Tanehokahoka and said,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"I will."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Then Tanehokahoka turned to the other birds and said,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"E Tui, because you were too scared to come down from the forest roof, from now on you will wear the two white feathers at your throat as the mark of a coward. Pukeko, because you did not want to get your feet wet, you will live forever in the swamp. Pipiwharauroa, because you were too busy building your nest, from now on you will never build another nest again, but lay your eggs in other birds nests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But you kiwi, because of your great sacrifice, you will become the most well known and most loved bird of them all."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The End&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Pukete Farm Park – has to be Hamilton’s best kept secret. It is a huge park of some 70 hectares filled with tree's and with multiple entrances off several quiet residential streets in the northern suburb of Pukete.

You have to take your dog for a walk here with all those tree's its a doggie paradise. There is a small  creek too so keep an eye on your mini-cachers.

The park is also the home of Hamilton mountain bike club although with the very wide spaces you would have to be very unlucky to "bump" into one. With this in mind be careful how you retrieve this cache as the area can be highly populated with muggles at times.

Please cover the cache as well as you can when you have finished. Thanks and good luck, enjoy your walk and come again soon.

This gave me more trouble than it should have. I visited here at the start of my trip, couldn't find it and I left before more people cruised down the path. I ended up finishing my ride here and searched for the cache again. This time, in the right hint item. How did I not see that the first time!? Damn. Anyway, tftc!</groundspeak:text>

However ancient traditions record that Hotumauea of Ngati Koura and his son Tutumua possessed the local lands and constructed a number of eel weirs in the creeks and swamps nearby. Once there was, to the west of the Pa an extensive Kahikatea bush stand where the Maori inhabitants gathered Tawa and Hinau berries. The Berries were placed in a woven kit, called a Pukete. They were then soaked in fresh water streams to remove toxins from the kernels and then cooked.

Pukete Pa was inhabited until the Waikato land wars of 1863.

OK, that was a brain strain, how about the bad stuff?&lt;br /&gt;
D= Number of red cards handed out (bonus points for knowing what
country/countries involved)&lt;br /&gt;
E= Yellow cards handed out to Namibia&lt;br /&gt;
Last one for a combo of things....&lt;br /&gt;

The Cache is not at the published coordinates, so please don’t go there unless you are really looking for places to visit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have all heard the expression, possibly said by some disapproving elder, “I said look, don’t touch, do your fingers have eyes?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another example of French ingenuity was the inventor Louis Braille who perfected what for the blind a system of writing and reading that would open up worlds for those who could not see. The original purpose was quite different from what we know today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed at the request of Napoleon for a code system which would enable soldiers to communicate silently without light at night called “Night Writing” by Charles Barbier. It was not until many years later that while visiting the National Institute for the Blind, in Paris, that he met Louis Braille, who then refined it to give us the system that we have today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First used by the Indian Scholar “Pingala” (approx. 5th-2nd century BC) for the simplification of the numbering system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1605 our old friend Francis Bacon &lt;font size="2" face="arial" color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Francis’s Cipher GC1DGGK)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; discussed a system whereby the entire alphabet could be expressed as sequences of binary digits "provided those objects be capable of a twofold difference only; as by Bells, by Trumpets, by Lights and Torches, by the report of Muskets, and any instruments of like nature”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1854 saw the British mathematician George Boole detailing a system of algebraic logic that we now know as Boolean Algebra using Boolean Expressions to express “truths”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entire concept caused me to spend an ordinate amount of my spare time many years ago locked in a computer lab with the express intention of understanding both Boolean Equations and predicting the outcomes. Yes, I passed the exam, however even today when I see them written down I have a sense of pending dread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are rearly going back in time, the original system, using the standard alphabet, could have 25 variations. What we are so familiar with today, ROT13, is one of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the title of this cache is slightly misleading, as the picture on the album cover is meaningless, the intent was correct until the marketing people got hold of the concept and changed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the need to send messages over long distances became more and more apparent in Post-Revolutionary France. Two brothers came up with the concept using mechanical towers, which later formed the basis for the hand held version of communication. In a trial carried out in 1790 between Paris and Lille (230km’s) a message was relayed in a period of 32 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it was quickly replaced in part by the electric telegraph it was used in various guises by many nations for the next 120 years. Today in Frankton, Hamilton, you are able to view a more modern version of the original system that was adapted for industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not quite up with today’s expectations thanks to mobile phone and text speak, but still a vast improvement on what had come before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the ages we have been the master craftsmen of the world. We were instrumental in the construction of many of the greatest buildings seen throughout Europe. One of our greatest examples is located approx. 80 kilometres southwest of Paris. Construction began in the late 1100’s and lasted 57 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building's exterior is dominated by heavy flying buttresses which allowed the architects to increase the window size significantly, while the west end is dominated by two contrasting spires - one, a 105 meter plain pyramid dating from the 1140s, and the other a 113 meter tall early 16th century spire on top of an older tower. Equally notable are the three great façades, each adorned with hundreds of sculpted figures illustrating key theological themes and narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since at least the 12th century the cathedral has been an important destination for travellers - and remains so to this day, attracting large numbers of Christian pilgrims, many of whom come to venerate its famous relic, the Sancta Camisa, said to be the tunic worn by the Virgin Mary at Christ's birth, as well as large numbers of secular tourists who come to see this very impressive building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having been there, visited and spent several hours wandering around it, taking it all in (Mrs Dragon indulged me at this point) was awe inspiring especially when you consider the tools they had to work with and no sign of computer modeling to ensure that they had got it all right.&lt;/p&gt;

After having no such luck the first time I looked here, I stopped here on the way back after thinking that I reckoned I knew where this was going to be... A one minute search in the right spot came up with a win. TFTC!

Er, I mean. Sorry, please me no speaking englaish!

&lt;p&gt;Located along the Kakepuku reserve mountain bike&lt;br /&gt;
track this cache takes in some splendid views on any Blue Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower Viewing Tower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop Return S 38º 04.267 E 175º 15.468&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kakepuku Views 3 GC23NWM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kakepuku Rock GC2F952&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue Day GC35KD7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Lower Viewing Tower (1) to Loop Return (2) the track is a steady climb on well defined grass track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point to get to the Blue Day cache you can either go straight up (the left track) which follows a fenceline 450m up a ridgeline where it then levels out to get to GZ (5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if you want to take in the whole loop from the Loop return point carry on straight ahead for an easy level walk to (3) and from here a sharp climb over a smaller ridge to (4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 4 a quick climb up to the mountain bike track summit and viewpoint then levels out and descends for a quick walk to GZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here it is all down back to the CP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all a great walk for an afternoon with great scenery and Bush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track can be slippery when wet and could have some mud sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other option of course is to mountainbike the complete loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going up the incline at the loop return is not advisable due to its steepness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also coming down here requires downhill experience as can be slippery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New track is currently being built from the upper MTB Summit to the Kakepuku summit and for now open for walkers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Great 360 degree views from the lookout platform at the summit. This cache replaces my Monk Hill cache that was placed in July 2004 and archived in October 2011. Still one of my favourite short Waikato walks and suitable for all couch potato's!!
&lt;p&gt;Only took about 25 min to the summit/cache with a six year old. The brochure produced by the Bush Trust says 20 min to the summit so take your pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 40 Hectare bush reserve was opened up for public access in 1993 and is administered by the David Johnstone Pukemokemoke Bush Trust. It is native bush with good examples of totara, matai kanuka, kahikatea and kauri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest heading to the summit via the Kauri grove then returning to your vehicle down the NE track via the log hauler site (equal distance each way). There is a nice picnic area with gazebo and a water supply at the log hauler site. The track is well formed and drained but can be a little slippery in places when wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is an ammo box. Please cover when replacing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The Karapiro Power Station is a hydroelectric power station on Waikato River. </groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The power station station lies on Lake Karapiro, 30 kilometres (19 mi) upstream from the city of Hamilton. Karapiro is the last of the eight hydroelectric power stations on the Waikato River.

Karapiro is a baseload power station, as it is required to maintain water flow in the lower Waikato River even during low inflows to the catchment and during low electricity demand. Only two turbines are required to keep the river flow at a reasonable level, with the third turbine being available for peak generation and maintenance on one of the other turbines.

Like all of the hydroelectric power stations on the Waikato River, Karapiro is operated by state-owned electricity generator Mighty River Power.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is about the journey, as someone once said, “there and back to see how far it is”. A simple journey for those who remember of the days when we went for the “Drive”, often with the parents, often against our will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take extreme care on the roads, these are country roads and they can be dangerous&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;b&gt;and we all need to keep safe for our friends and family.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caches only have a Logbook. Bring a Pen, and possibly an extraction device (especially if the previous person signing the log stuffed it to the base of the cache container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series of roads this is based along is a journey that I was subjected to several times over the years, so thought it only fair that I set up the journey for &lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;“YOU”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;. There was a time when this route was much travelled as an overland path between two harbours, Kawhia and Raglan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To break up the journey there are two caches at the “Bridal Veil Falls”. It also gives the kids a chance to run off a bit that pent up energy, for the next leg of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two Bonus Caches as part of the journey, one for those heading North and another for those heading South. Now, who’s going to go for both Bonus Caches?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;important&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; part here is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Green Letters/Numbers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; are for the &lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;North Bonus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Cache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Red Letters/Numbers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; are for the &lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;South Bonus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Cache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking of the kids, I have ensured that the items starting in the Bonus Caches I have tried to include items to keep the kids occupied for the return journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The series of roads this is based along is a journey that I was subjected to several times over the years, so thought it only fair that I set up the journey for &lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;“YOU”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;To break up the journey there are two caches at the “Bridal Veil Falls”. It also gives the kids a chance to run off a bit that pent up energy, for the next leg of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two Bonus Caches as part of the journey, one for those heading North and another for those heading South. Now, who’s going to go for both Bonus Caches?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caches only have a Logbook. Bring a Pen, and possibly an extraction device (especially if the previous person signing the log stuffed it to the base of the cache container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series of roads this is based along is a journey that I was subjected to several times over the years, so thought it only fair that I set up the journey for &lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;“YOU”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;. There was a time when this route was much travelled as an overland path between two harbours, Kawhia and Raglan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To break up the journey there are two caches at the “Bridal Veil Falls”. It also gives the kids a chance to run off a bit that pent up energy, for the next leg of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two Bonus Caches as part of the journey, one for those heading North and another for those heading South. Now, who’s going to go for both Bonus Caches?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;important&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; part here is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Green Letters/Numbers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; are for the &lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;North Bonus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Cache&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking of the kids, I have ensured that the items starting in the Bonus Caches I have tried to include items to keep the kids occupied for the return journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caches only have a Logbook. Bring a Pen, and possibly an extraction device (especially if the previous person signing the log stuffed it to the base of the cache container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series of roads this is based along is a journey that I was subjected to several times over the years, so thought it only fair that I set up the journey for &lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;“YOU”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;. There was a time when this route was much travelled as an overland path between two harbours, Kawhia and Raglan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To break up the journey there are two caches at the “Bridal Veil Falls”. It also gives the kids a chance to run off a bit that pent up energy, for the next leg of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two Bonus Caches as part of the journey, one for those heading North and another for those heading South. Now, who’s going to go for both Bonus Caches?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;important&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; part here is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Green Letters/Numbers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; are for the &lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;North Bonus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Cache&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking of the kids, I have ensured that the items starting in the Bonus Caches I have tried to include items to keep the kids occupied for the return journey.&lt;/p&gt;

to the adjacent tree&lt;/p&gt;

$20. Wrap it in Christmas theme. Remember this is SUMMER! and the
box will be in the sun. CHOCOLATE is NOT a good idea&lt;br /&gt;
2. Find the box - chat to others that visit.!&lt;br /&gt;
3. Log yourself in the logbook, so we can verify your online log
later.&lt;br /&gt;
4. PLACE your gift in the box, and select one of the already
wrapped gift items in exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.LINGER awhile and SHARE some Christmas nibbles in the garden
-&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;BYO drinks. We will supply a few finger food nibbles for
afternoon tea. Tea and (instant) coffee available if
requested.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ENJOY the chances of meeting others, and have a little
Christmas&lt;br /&gt;
fun!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THIS EVENT IS PLACED WITH CONSIDERATION TO PLANTS. Please do
not damage the garden.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">There is public walkway atop the stopbanks along both sides of the stream, and the city council have laid a nice track along one side. This walkway is over 9km long and makes for a great family cycle trip. Check out the stream out after a heavy rain - it is quite a sight.

The track starts at the north corner out of town, just off Milson Line, at S40°19.530' E175°36.087'. The other end is at the end of Totora Road, at S40º23.272', E175º34.475', however there are numerous entrances onto the track, wherever the stream is crossed by a road.

The log book and container lid have a coordinate part for the final cache of the series, Mangaone Stream 5.

This cache is is on the back edge of Bill Brown Park. It is a 700ml Sistema container. FTF gets to FTF a new bug [^]

To solve this puzzle you need to visit the listed co-ordinates with a required code.

The cache is hidden at the listed co-ord's and is an easy find but getting into the log book may prove to take a little more brain power.

To find the code to get to the log you need to locate a 4 digit number related to the theme of the cache.

* Below are co-ordinates to the car park. Make sure you close all the gates behind you
* I build the 'device' myself so hopefully it holds together, a little care when operating.</groundspeak:long_description>

Released as a single in April, it spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and one week on the Cash Box Top 100, nearly a year after its recording. A year later, it re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968 following the success of Jose Feliciano's version of the song, peaking at number 87. The song was largely written by Robby Krieger,[1] and credited to the entire band. The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1967, representing sales of one million units.[2]
A live version was released in 1983 on their album Alive, She Cried, the first of several live albums released in subsequent decades to include the song. "Light My Fire" achieved modest success in Australia, where it peaked at #22 on the ARIA chart. The single originally reached #49 in the UK in 1967, but experienced belated success in that country in 1991 when a re-issue peaked at #7. The re-issue occurred on the back of revived interest in the band following Oliver Stone's film biopic "The Doors". The song is #35 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.[3] It was included in the Songs of the Century list and was ranked number 7 in VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of All Time list. José Feliciano's cover version won a 1969 Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, the same year he won another Grammy for Best New Artist.

DANGER:  the cache is located within the reserve but near the railway line.  Do not cross the fence.....there is no need to. Do not proceed anywhere near the railway tracks.

There is a seat close by overlooking the reserve and its a good place for train spotting as well.

Cache is a small click clack placed at the end of the line ( not the railway line)

It is widely agreed that an Englishmen, John Spilsbury invented the jigsaw puzzle in ??A??. Spilsbury was an engraver and mapmaker. The ??B?? jigsaw puzzle was a map of the world. Spilsbury attached a map to a piece of wood and then cut out each country. Teachers used Spilsbury's puzzles to teach geography. Students learned their geography lessons by putting the world maps back together.

The idea caught on and, until about ??C???, jigsaw puzzles remained primarily educational tools.

In 1880, with the introduction of the treadle saw, what had previously been known as dissections (not a word with particularly enjoyable connotations in our own time) came to be known as jigsaw puzzles, although they were actually cut by a fretsaw, not a true jigsaw. Towards the end of the century plywood came to be used.  With illustrations glued or painted on the front of the wood, pencil tracings of where to cut were made on the back.  These pencil tracings can still be found on some of these older puzzles.  

Cardboard puzzles were first introduced in the late ?D?00's, and were primarily used for children's puzzles.  It was not until the 20th century that cardboard puzzles came to be die-cut, a process whereby thin strips of metal with sharpened edges - rather like a giant cookie-cutter - are twisted into intricate patterns and fastened to a plate.  The "die" (which refers to this assembly of twisted metal on the plate) is placed in a press, which is pressed down on the cardboard to make the cut.

Thus, in the early ?E?00's, both wooden and cardboard jigsaw puzzles were available.  Wooden puzzles still dominated, as manufacturers were convinced that customers would not be interested in "cheap" cardboard puzzles.  Of course, a second motivation on the part of manufacturers and retailers of jigsaw puzzles was that the profit from a wooden puzzle, which might sell for $?F?.00, was far greater than for a cardboard jigsaw puzzle, which would usually sell for about 25¢.  

The Golden Age of jigsaw puzzles came in the 1920s and 1930s with companies like Chad Valley and Victory in Great Britain and Einson-Freeman, Viking and others in the United States producing a wide range of puzzles reflecting both the desire for sentimental scenes, enthusiasm for the new technologies in rail and shipping and, last but not least, new marketing strategies.  

One strategy was to make cardboard puzzles more intricate and difficult, thus appealing as much to adults as to children.  Another was to use jigsaw puzzles as premiums for advertising purposes.  Einson-Freeman of Long Island City, New York began this practice in 1931, making puzzles that were given away with toothbrushes.  Other premiums followed, but more important to the jigsaw puzzle's enduring success was the introduction of the weekly puzzle.  This practice began in the United States in September, 19?G? - very much the depth of the Depression - with an initial printing of 12,000 puzzles.  Soon after, printings rose to 100,000 and then 200,000.

It might seem odd at first glance that a non-necessity like a jigsaw puzzle would sell so well in the Depression.  But the appeal, then as now, was that one bought a good deal of entertainment for a small price.  The weekly jigsaw puzzle could constitute a solitary or group activity, and would occupy one's time enjoyably for hours.  And, of course, a jigsaw puzzle was "recyclable," in that one could break the puzzle up once one had completed it and then pass it on to another family member or friend.  Another point to bear in mind that jigsaw puzzle enthusiasts in the Depression discovered what many in our own time are rediscovering - that working on a jigsaw puzzle is a great way to reduce stress!

The popularity of jigsaw puzzles has waxed and waned since the Depression.  They are still, just like the first jigsaw puzzle, sometimes used to teach geography: I recall assembling a puzzle of the continental states of the USA when I was a boy.  (Texas was an easy piece to locate, Colorado quite challenging.)  They are still available in both wood and cardboard.  They are still a lot of entertainment for a small price.  Jigsaw puzzles are a pastime, and I will make no nobler claim for them.  But they are a healthier pastime than watching inane (and occasionally vulgar) television shows or playing inane (and occasionally vulgar and/or violent) computer games.   And if they are addictive - and they are - they are a harmless addiction.

Makohine railway viaduct.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I have placed this cache here because the location bears special
significance to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was a young child this photograph has hung on the
wall at our house&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photograph is of the Makohine Viaduct in 1902.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="308" width="800" src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/49539bef-018f-4e25-a84d-47bd9f52b166.jpg?rnd=0.6103434" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was taken by a world famous panoramic photographer named
Melvin Vaniman.Vaniman is famous for being an "Acrobatic
Photographer."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He often photographed from hot air balloons, ships mast's, tall
buildings and even a home made 30m wooden pole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first train crossed the Makohine Viaduct on the 9th of June
in 1902.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since construction the Viaduct has been an icon for both
train and car travelers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture has been passed down from my mothers side from my
at least my great grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a young child, this photograph always seemed special
to me, and whenever we would drive by, my dad would always point
out the Viaduct to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I feel as well as being special to me, it also presents a
historic record of the area, we can see where the road and rivers
went as well as what the landscape was like at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a 400ml camo sistema that is hidden at the end of
the field, so creek hopping may be needed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="VERDANA" size="4"&gt;Please shut the gate behind
you!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun while taking in the beauty of this structure!&lt;/p&gt;

As part of this paper I wanted to show the students what a real cache looks like and how people sign the log etc. Part of the option paper is going to involve the students designing their own cache puzzles or containers. Clearly I do not recommend doing this cache during school starting and finishing hours but other than that go for it. You do not need to enter school grounds to collect this cache.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Kauri Grove is situated on Shakespeare Road, at the Southern end of the Shakespeare St bridge which crosses the Waikato river. This bridge is known locally as the "Lower Bridge".
The Kauri Grove was planted by the Rotary Club of Cambridge to celebrate 50 years of Community service to Cambridge and the district.
There are some 30 trees are in this Grove. A number of new ones were planted in 2002 and 2004 in the rear of the grove to fill in some gaps. 

On the bank below the Kauri Grove fronting on to the Waikato River, two major plantings were done in 2002 and 2004. In 2004, over 300 shrubs of all types were planted with much help from Year 9 Cambridge High Science Classes.

From this point you can see the High level bridge and the low level bridge, and is the point where Karapiro Stream enters the mighty Waikato River. Across the river is one of the last moorings that small ships could navigate up the river from Port Waikato before it got to shallow and to narrow... 

Andersen Family’s first Cache we have made.  Difficultly level is due to the type of hide, at the way points it is in plain view, there is no need to dig around.  Watch out for Muggles.

There is room for trackables.
If you think the hide is worth a favorite point, I would appreciate it.

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is a replacement for "GC3766P Are we There Yet? #18", now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is about the journey, as someone once said, “there and back to see how far it is”. A simple journey for those who remember of the days when we went for the “Drive”, often with the parents, often against our will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take extreme care on the roads, these are country roads and they can be dangerous&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;b&gt;and we all need to keep safe for our friends and family.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
with improved coordinates.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/a671d057-2cea-4a51-aec1-e246b7ad896a.jpg" align="right" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caches only have a Logbook. Bring a Pen, and possibly an extraction device (especially if the previous person signing the log stuffed it to the base of the cache container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series of roads this is based along is a journey that I was subjected to several times over the years, so thought it only fair that I set up the journey for &lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;“YOU”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;. There was a time when this route was much travelled as an overland path between two harbours, Kawhia and Raglan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To break up the journey there are two caches at the “Bridal Veil Falls”. It also gives the kids a chance to run off a bit that pent up energy, for the next leg of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two Bonus Caches as part of the journey, one for those heading North and another for those heading South. Now, who’s going to go for both Bonus Caches?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;important&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; part here is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Green Letters/Numbers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; are for the &lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;North Bonus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Cache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Red Letters/Numbers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; are for the &lt;font size="3" face="arial" color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;South Bonus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Cache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking of the kids, I have ensured that the items starting in the Bonus Caches I have tried to include items to keep the kids occupied for the return journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link below takes in an ‘Advertisement’ that I think recalls those days of the “Sunday Drive” &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8l5Fk_xz0w%3Cfont%20size="&gt;&lt;b&gt;Family Road Trip&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;For Bonus Caches&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;South A B . C D E&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;East F G . H I J&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

We are very new to Hamilton so this is our first cache in the area - we thought we'd make it a nice easy one.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;
We were surprised to find there were no caches by this nice little lake, which we thought made for a nice location.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Updated 24 March: We moved the cache from its original location by the bench after some warnings from locals that the area tends to flood in the winter. We still recommend you walk down to the water's edge as this is a lovely spot. We saw lots of ducks and also plenty of swallows skimming the water in search of a meal when we visited.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a screw-top container, not far off the path, hopefully safe from muggles' eyes but please be discreet anyway.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;strong&gt;THE ABOVE COORDINATES ARE BOGUS. Please read the WHOLE DESCRIPTION below to find out:&lt;br /&gt;
1. what you need to do to work out the correct coordinates; and&lt;br /&gt;
2. what to do once you find yourself at GZ.&lt;/strong&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;div style="color:darkgreen;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The woods are hiding a secret&lt;br /&gt;
that you somehow need to extract;&lt;br /&gt;
All you need is a little magic,&lt;br /&gt;
the lack of a wand needn't be tragic.&lt;br /&gt;
The tool you need is in your hand&lt;br /&gt;
(when you see it you'll understand).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:13px;"&gt;Please do leave the cache intact!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRANSLATION:&lt;/strong&gt; You do NOT need to bring any tools with you to extract the log, nor do you need to go rummaging in the woods to find one. All you need is provided with the cache. Just try thinking outside the box a little, rather than rush to do "the obvious"! The cache should NOT be moved in any way nor its contents forced out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caution:&lt;/strong&gt; path may be slippery when wet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important:&lt;/strong&gt; Bring your own pen! No swag or visitor's cards please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="color:red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REAL Coordinates:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work out the real coordinates all you need to do is solve the easy sudoku puzzle below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;S 37° AB.CDE&lt;br /&gt;
E 175° FG.HIJ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(scroll to the bottom for a link to check your answer)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/3e584f48-349c-4ead-9a5e-b354cebe2d45.jpg?rnd=0.415624" style="width:300px;" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the time of placing the cache, we found this on approach to GZ:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/0dcbd40f-0d64-45eb-a419-265ab645d0e7.jpg?rnd=0.2007871" style="width:500px;" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The GPS was a little unstable under tree cover - so here's a small spoiler. GZ is somewhere in this picture below, hope this helps a little (just a little - we didn't want to spoil it completely).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/0d53fade-09da-4008-8a04-c75797489b83.jpg?rnd=0.4305645" style="width:500px;" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div style="border:2px dashed black;padding:15px;background-color:#FFFFE0;"&gt;&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logging Etiquette:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some of our caches have taken a fair amount of time/effort to think up, construct, and place. This is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We really hope you enjoy the hunt and the cache. Now, when logging your visit, please consider that we love reading comments from finders and it's pretty discouraging to get a lazy "found" or "TFTC" log for a cache you've put a lot of effort into... Whilst we are not expecting you to write a novel, or to shower us with praise, a short log that says something about your experience (whether you liked it or hated it, whether it needs maintenance, etc.) will be very much appreciated - and it will also help prove to us that you were actually there and not just couch-caching :p&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PS. Spoiler logs will be deleted! :(&lt;/div&gt;

Cache is hidden of the right hand side of the flax bush.  It is against the fence and is covered as best i can with the litter around.

People who don't procrastinate can create incredible things... like the  Waiwhakareke Natural Heritage Park.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The natural ecosystems of Hamilton City in the northern North Island of New Zealand have almost been completely destroyed, with only 1.6 % of its original native vegetation cover now remaining. Many ecological restoration projects are underway across the city to repair remnant ecosystems  but Hamilton City is also home to a very special ecological reconstruction project at the Waiwhakareke Natural Heritage Park (WNHP).

WNHP encompasses 60 hectares of council-owned land, including Horseshoe Lake, in north-western Hamilton. The project is considered to be an ecological reconstruction because the area was deforested, drained, and converted to agricultural pasture 150 years ago and thus, provided no native elements to restore when it was land-banked in the late 1990’s. An ecological reconstruction project was proposed because the varied topography and soil types of the area provide an opportunity to recreate the full range of historic local ecosystems. The project began in 2004 with support from the Hamilton City Council, University of Waikato, Waikato Institute of Technology, local iwi groups, Tui 2000 and many members of the public.

The WHNP ecological reconstruction plan is underpinned by practical experience, local knowledge and ecological theory. It has been set up as a long term experiment to understand the practical aspects of bringing indigenous nature back into the city and aims to produce robust ecological reconstruction guidelines that are applicable throughout New Zealand and across the world.

All of the plants you see have been planted by people who share a vision to recreate a forest that they themselves will never see but that their great grandchildren will enjoy. For more info please see: http://waiwhakareke.co.nz/

To access the cache please use the gate on Baverstock road (S 37 46.415 E 175 13.547) next to the sign, it is fine to park on the grass up the kerb. 

SAFETY: WNHP is surrounded by a working farm. ELECTRIC FENCES ARE LIVE. The gate is padlocked so you will need to climb over it. WNHP is not currently open to the public but permission for access has be granted.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;A collective noun is a word used to define a group of objects, where objects can be people, animals, inanimate objects, anything really. Sometimes a term will apply only in a certain context. A group of geese on the ground is referred to as a 'gaggle of geese' while a 'skein of geese' refers to them in flight. It is acknowledged that the lesser-known words of this type are not needed for practical purposes. However, the coining of collective nouns remains commonplace among writers eg a bench of magistrates, an expectation of midwives, a clique of photographers, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you seek? A copse of trees? &lt;b&gt;A Cluster&lt;/b&gt; of roundabouts? A row of houses? A confusion of road signs, perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simply adjust the final three digits of the listed co-ordinates, both south &amp;amp; east, to reveal the cache’s true location.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="white"&gt;Did you solve the anagram? Or maybe you just found this text? Either way, the answer is: add 591 to the south co-ords &amp;amp; 292 to the east. Too easy. Do you really need geocheck??&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Tucked in the back corner of Apollo Park a hard-working group of volunteers have established a butterfly garden - it's even in the shape of a butterfly.  Bring the family - there is a children's playground nearby as well.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Locals had noticed how Monarch butterflies spent winter in the large willow trees in Apollo Park.  From here the idea of creating a butterfly park was developed.  Native shrubs, grasses and swan plants have been planted to attract more monarchs as well as New Zealand's native butterflies such as the red admiral, yellow admiral, copper and little blue butterflies.

This community project has been supported by the Palmerston North City Council and other sponsors, and is still a work in progress.

The camo cache container contains a log book and pencil.  There is no room for trades.  When logging your find please describe any butterfly sightings you have made, thanks!</groundspeak:long_description>

A fairly flat terrain. Fine for pushchairs, great for children. A few trees too!</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Slightly off path, but not by much. Our kids love to wonder through this off path area anyway. 

This cache is in a yellow/greenish plastic container which contains a log book, pencil and stash of treasures. 

Dogs on leads ok.  Car park closes 1/2 hour before sunset.

Had cache all set to go in August last year, but it took us until now to get it hidden - hence the old date on log in cache.

You may find some Funky Chicks in some of the caches – they are called Nancy, Pinkie, Mabel and Ruby. If you find one of the Funky Chicks please take her for a walk and take some photos of her having fun. PLEASE don’t take the Funky Chicks home with you though, but place her into a cache before you leave the arboretum and post your photos with your cache logs.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a favourite spot for local muggle children: please re-hide well. &lt;br /&gt;

Updated 16.6.12: Butterfly Lady kindly organised a CITO event to tidy up GZ. Even so, best not reach inside the building as there may still be some glass around. Cache is a small sistema with logbook, pencil &amp;amp; a few small trades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

'The festival of the lights' is on over the Christmas period. Our cache overlooks the fountain lake, up a side path. There is no need to get off the path. Please rehide carefully and replace it's rain hat!. There are a few paths in view of the cache so please have a good look around before you go for the cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You may find some Funky Chicks in some of the caches – they are called Nancy, Pinkie, Mabel and Ruby. If you find one of the Funky Chicks please take her for a walk and take some photos of her having fun. PLEASE don’t take the Funky Chicks home with you though, but place her into a cache before you leave the arboretum and post your photos with your cache logs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To help keep the log books dry please return the log book into the plastic bag and ensure the Click-Clack containers are placed right-way-up when you rehide the cache – if they are placed up-side-down, water will eventually get into the caches. Please recover cache when you rehide it. Watch out for the branches.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have fun and enjoy your walk. Bring a picnic lunch, but be aware that we have had sandwiches taken from our hands by chickens! Dogs on leads ok, cark park is locked at night.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About This Cache:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history that lead to the New Zealand nation as we know it now includes the land wars of 1850- 1870. Historians have presented a number of differing accounts of what really happened over those years, and the full understating of what occurred will continue to develop as our society changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is certain, is that the Waikato town of Alexandra, (now known as Pirongia) was an outpost between two peoples, and a number of fortified sites were developed around this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander Redoubt East was constructed on this site in 1864, after the Waikato war was over, at the edge of the land that the dispossessed Maori who had retreated south into the King Country controlled. The redoubt housed 100 men of the 2nd Waikato Regiment, protecting the surveying and development of the land in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you take the short walk to the hide, review the signage here and cast your mind back to those days where this land was claimed by two peoples with different ideas of what ownership meant, and enjoy the peaceful view of the river below, a major highway in the 19th Century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a 2litre click-clack container. Please take care to re-hide it well, this is a reasonably public location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are encouraged to include pictures with your log (just no spoilers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This cache, and others placed by us at the Taitua Arboretum has been created by our family with families in mind. There are lots of puzzle caches are around that are challenging to solve that are great for adults, but we wanted to create some caches that children and families can enjoy together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Different breeds of chickens lay different colour and sized eggs.&lt;br /&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/87785632@N06/8033401365/" title="eggphoto by kiwiteachernz, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8033/8033401365_1d1e82a3e8_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="eggphoto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is not hidden egg-tactly at the above location.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How many eggs did the Funky Chicks lay? Some days they were egg-cellent layers, other days were egg-tremely busy doing egg-citing things (like stealing sandwiches) they were too egg- hausted to lay. Their favourite place to lay is somewhere egg-tra private. Take a closer look at their egg laying habits so you can egg-tract the cache location.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven't done a puzzle cache before, see &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/87785632@N06/8034393825/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for instructions on how to load Final co-ordinates into your iPhone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You may find some Funky Chicks in some of the caches – they are called Nancy, Pinkie, Mabel and Ruby. If you find one of the Funky Chicks please take her for a walk and take some photos of her having fun. PLEASE don’t take the Funky Chicks home with you though, but place her into a cache before you leave the arboretum and post your photos with your cache logs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/87785632@N06/8034334672/" title="IMG_0985 by kiwiteachernz, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8319/8034334672_960dbb39bb_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="IMG_0985" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To help keep the log books dry please return the log book into the plastic bag and ensure the Click-Clack containers are placed right-way-up when you rehide the cache – if they are placed up-side-down, water will eventually get into the caches.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dogs on leads ok. Car park is locked at night. If this is your first puzzle cache, go here http://flic.kr/p/deYnnt for instructions on how to load the Final co-ordinates into your Iphone.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Lake Rotokauri is located seven kilometres north-west of Hamilton city. It has a surface area of 77 hectares and a maximum depth of four metres.

Lake Rotokauri is a peat lake and is part of the Waipa peat lake complex.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is one of 8 caches hidden at Lake Rotokauri - so look up other caches and make your trip out here worth while. None of the caches are in flax bushes!

Closest parking is Dromara Drive, but parking is also available at Pheasant Close and Bunyard Road if you are wanting a longer stroll. There's a toilet near the gate from Dromara Drive.

Not a drive-by and grab.

This is a duck shooting lake, so an early morning cache hunt in May-June may be a little noisy - hence the cache name.

You are looking for a 200ml container than has been camouflaged. Room for small swaps and non-bulky trackables. 

Cache is near the end of the path. Hopefully the path will be extended in the future so we can walk further around the lake.

May be wet under-foot around here in winter, but cache is not at ground level.

Please re-hide and cover with care.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A family friendly cache that your children can solve. The above co-ordinates are bogus, but a great place to park. Solve the crossword to locate the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located at S37 AB.CEA, E175 FC.EGF. If you haven't solved a puzzle cache before, see &lt;a&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
for instructions on how to load Final co-ordinates into your Iphone.&lt;br /&gt;

Oops, the chickens ate the clues! Solve the cross word without the clues, then work out the co-ordinates to locate the cache.&lt;br /&gt;

You may find some Funky Chicks in some of the caches we have created – they are called Nancy, Pinkie, Mabel and Ruby. If you find one of the Funky Chicks please take her for a walk and take some photos of her having fun. PLEASE don’t take the Funky Chicks home with you though, but place her into a cache before you leave the arboretum and post your photos with your cache logs&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To help keep the log books dry please return the log book into the plastic bag and ensure the Click-Clack containers are placed right-way-up when you rehide the cache – if they are placed up-side-down, water will eventually get into the caches. Please place cache so it's out of sight when you rehide it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have fun and enjoy your walk. Bring a picnic lunch, but be aware that we have had sandwiches taken from our hands by chickens! Dogs on leads ok. Carpark is locked at night.&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks to Ladylitefoot for the dancing chickens.

&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for small camo container. &lt;span&gt;You'll need to find the two 'tools' to retrieve cache. Please use the one with the yellow rubber band to retrieve and the unmarked one to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
BYO pen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We'll keep a close on the logs in case maintenance is required. Please replace 'tools' carefully.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you've found the cache, locate the black plastic pallets, follow the path and check out the maimai nearby (unless of course you are out here in duck shotting session).&lt;/span&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The last cache in the area was a tribute to the athletic side of Porritt Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However this cache is based around the footballing side of Porritt Stadium. Great cache to come and find in the winter and watch a bit of football &lt;img alt="smiley" height="20" src="http://htmleditor.in/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/regular_smile.gif" title="smiley" width="20" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware though the football bug could bite and you may get the fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a &lt;strong&gt;regular sistema container&lt;/strong&gt; placed in a &lt;strong&gt;camo bag&lt;/strong&gt;. Please &lt;strong&gt;bring your own pen&lt;/strong&gt; and  be respectful of the environment when retrieving and replacing this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;no need to go down the embankment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - be mindful if you have little children around the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;strong&gt;dog exercise area&lt;/strong&gt; so feel free to bring your pooch with. However please be aware of the following guidelines (amongst others listed on the council's signage) :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dogs may exercise off the leash except on weekdays after 5pm and on weekends after 10.30am between 01 April and 30 September&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please keep your dog away from areas where sport is being played.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;rehide well&lt;/strong&gt; as this area gets many visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* At the time of placement, the cache contained 1 logbook + 6 TBs + 2 marbles + 1 miniature deck of cards *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*** FTF goes to HKCB, congrats!! ***&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;For a moment there you guys thought there would be another one of these:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The cache is NOT at the listed co-ordinates, but it is a useful starting point.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;A collective noun is a word used to define a group of objects, where objects can be people, animals, inanimate objects, anything really. Sometimes a term will apply only in a certain context. A group of geese on the ground is referred to as a 'gaggle of geese' while a 'skein of geese' refers to them in flight. It is acknowledged that the lesser-known words of this type are not needed for practical purposes. However, the coining of collective nouns remains commonplace among writers eg a bench of magistrates, an expectation of midwives, a clique of photographers, and so on.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;So what do you seek? A copse of trees? A cluster of roundabouts? A row of houses? A confusion of road signs, perhaps?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simply replace the final three digits of the listed co-ordinates, both south &amp;amp; east, to reveal the cache’s true location.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;font color="white"&gt;Hoping for a hint? OK...the solve has absolutely nothing to do with birds, animals or collective nouns ... Or anything to do with the previous cluster puzzles..... keep scrolling down the page...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/a6891cdd-827c-49d4-93ed-52b66032a1b0.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Instead of solving the above puzzle (which is nice too) you will have to solve the "cluster" of QR codes below instead!! (do you wish it was the above puzzle now?)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please Geocheck your answer just in case it is one of those nasty corrected coord type of puzzles.....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Whewells Bush Scientific Reserve is an amazing 11ha kahikatea stand, but please note that &lt;strong&gt;the reserve is accessible by permit only. &lt;/strong&gt;The cache is hidden near the reserve access on Swallow Lane.  Please do not go into the reserve unless you have prior approval from DOC.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the original vegetation and forests of the Waikato basin have been cleared, leaving only small remnants such as Whewell's Bush, Yarndley’s Bush and Barrett Bush. These stands of trees are like pieces of a jigsaw; similar yet different from each other and all necessary for an accurate picture of what the whole was once like.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A jigsaw? Mmmm, a fitting place then to hide &lt;strong&gt;a clue&lt;/strong&gt; (or two?) to help you get started with the &lt;strong&gt;Tamahere Cluster puzzles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And if you've solved all (or most) of the series or just hate puzzle caches, well, at least it's another smilie for you to collect.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;div&gt;On Saturday, 5 April 2008 a serious explosion and subsequent fire occurred at the Icepak Coolstores facility in Tamahere near Hamilton. The incident followed a routine response by two Hamilton fire crews to a smoke detector in an industrial building and resulted in the death of one firefighter and serious injury to seven others. The fire burnt for a week and the event attracted global interest as one of the world's most severe incidents involving hydrocarbon refrigerants. Other firefighters and locals who assisted the injured firefighters were recognised in an official ceremony in April 2010, when a memorial was unveiled to thank the local community for their bravery and community spirit.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img alt src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/b287edfb-49d4-4de3-ac2c-2c4335358ef7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The memorial is at the local community centre; because that's right by the local primary school, the cache has been placed by the former Icepak facility instead. An eerie spot. You are looking for a camo eclipse mint tin.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A collective noun is a word used to define a group of objects, where objects can be people, animals, inanimate objects, anything really. Sometimes a term will apply only in a certain context. A group of geese on the ground is referred to as a 'gaggle of geese' while a 'skein of geese' refers to them in flight. It is acknowledged that the lesser-known words of this type are not needed for practical purposes. However, the coining of collective nouns remains commonplace among writers eg a bench of magistrates, an expectation of midwives, a clique of photographers, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

I found this cache container while out caching a few days ago. There are the usual swaps inside the cache along with two containers for those who want them to make new caches. Cache is large enough for those TB with really big tags.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Open cache from the bottom - but pull it out of camo to see what it actually is. Please recover cache when you rehide them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cross the natural bridge you find and head towards two tall tree to the north west. Cache is pretty much in line with two big trees but the nearer I got to GZ the less happy GPS was. Hint will spoil the fun for you...

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="white"&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;This time of year (December) Lake Ngaroto walkway takes on a new look&lt;br /&gt;
The track Narrows as the new growth of weed species takes hold.&lt;br /&gt;
Convolvulus creeps its way through everything and blackberry consumes the ferns.&lt;br /&gt;
Since June 2012 the first attack on weeds took place with selective plant removal and planting of new natives as well which you will see as you work your way from the car park to this cache.&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of clearing has been done taking care to retain certain plants.&lt;br /&gt;
Talking to some walkers they like the work been done and hope that some of the character will remain here..they enjoy the manuka canopy and the Black fern glades and hope that they will remain.&lt;br /&gt;
Just ahead of this cache is a newly planted area which features some young kauri being planted and some other selected species as well.&lt;br /&gt;
The reference way point added will take you to a gravel path leading to this proposed native walkway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="white"&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/f9833f31-3c7e-495d-8ad7-f50fb95a8d31.jpg?rnd=0.5070246" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="white"&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please search carefully..cache is slightly camouflaged by neighboring fern.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;For Peat's Sake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lake Serpentine complex consists of three separate lakes joined by a wetland area. The lakes and their margins are Wildlife Management Reserve and managed by Department of Conservation and Waipa District Council. These are one of the few lakes in the Waikato with an intact native macrophyte community remaining, and for this reason it is the Waikato Conservancy's priority lake site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;History&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wetlands were once a widespread feature of the landscape within the lower Waikato Basin and Hauraki Plains, through which the Waikato, Waihou and Piako Rivers run. In pre-European times, the extensive swamps of the Waikato basin were an important resource base for Māori. Many Pā (fortified settlements) were sited adjacent to the swamps or in the swamps themselves, utilising the swamp for its defensive effect – making palisades less necessary.&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/d94986d0-3e1b-4ad7-bfaf-4091b9aca14a.png" align="right" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the process of converting forested areas to farms, many swamps were drained on a large scale by commercial land companies in the 1800s, but drainage schemes continued into the 1900s. Today, only 20% of the original extent of wetlands in the region remain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In some areas, however, drainage was incomplete, perhaps because the land was too marginal or difficult given the technology at the time. The Serpentine Peat Lakes (or Rotopiko) was one such area. While these wetlands have been inexorably altered by surrounding land use, they nevertheless remain intact – if not in their original form. Evidence of attempted drainage and clearance can be seen in the stand of large kahikatea next to the peat lake; not tall enough to be original; they are likely to have regenerated decades ago from kahikatea swamp forest that was cleared but remained unsuitable for stock owing to its sogginess underfoot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How peat lakes differ from other lakes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peat forms from the build up of partially rotted plant material in wet environments. Peat lakes form in peatland areas such as bogs. Peat soils have a marked effect on the physical, chemical and biological nature of peat lakes. For example, the water is usually stained a brownish colour due to the high levels of dissolved organic matter leaching from adjoining peat soils. Water in the bottom of the lake is usually mildly acidic and often low in dissolved oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peat lakes have unique plants and animals that have evolved to cope with their acidic conditions. Changes in water quality due to the surrounding land use could threaten these specialised plants and animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/77989d31-9913-4583-8fd6-ca571b389979.jpg" align="right" width="300" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peatlands&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peatlands take many thousands of years to develop. They develop where the rate of plant growth is greater than the rate of decay, and contain plants that are specially adapted to the waterlogged conditions and low nutrient levels. &lt;font size="2" face="arial" color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peatlands are fragile ecosystems that are susceptible to fire, increases in nutrients and the effect of drainage.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Birds of the Peatland&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/281cbe63-356c-4074-9b59-a2826045803a.png" align="right" width="300" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unique plants and animals have adapted to living in the conditions provided by peat lakes and adjoining wetlands. A diverse range of bird species either depend on or frequent wetlands and can be found on the open water or around the margins of the lakes. The Australasian bittern and the New Zealand dabchick are two resident species now classed as ‘threatened’ due to low numbers and disappearing habitat. Other species include waterfowl like grey duck, grey teal, New Zealand shoveler, little black and black shag. The margins provide habitat for species such as banded rail, marsh and spotless crake, white faced heron, pukeko and North Island fernbird. Common introduced species include mallard duck, canada geese and black swan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="sienna"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also known as the "Kuruwhengi"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="sienna"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where are they found?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/692df538-d46f-4146-bad9-0a5d7088aa03.jpg" align="right" width="300" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prefering fertile wetlands, preferring still water ponds and lakes, slow-moving rivers and estuaries. The Shoveler is found throughout New Zealand and one of the few native birds not under protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="sienna"&gt;&lt;b&gt;FACTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The male shoveler is New Zealand's most handsome duck, with variegated plumage, blue-grey head with a white vertical stripe between the eye and bill, a striking reddish-brown breast, and blue wings. Nature has lavished more beauty on the male than the less attractive female.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shovelers swim with their bill submerged, sieving food from the water surface, and even through mud. The shoveler's sifting apparatus is very well developed with fine growths called lamellae on the edges of it's large wedge shaped bill, and bristles on its' tongue that sieve soft food.&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/840cc9d6-0718-468c-a4de-cc6024d59ccb.jpg" align="right" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six to ten cream-coloured eggs with a blue tint are laid between August and December. The female is the sole incubator for 26 days. The peculiar broad bill is predominant as soon as the chick is hatched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their food is primarily fresh water invertebrates and the seeds of aquatic plants, however, worms and insects are sometimes eaten in flooded pasture. The population is constantly threatened by the drainage of their preferred wetland habitat of fertile raupo edged shallows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="sienna"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also known as the "Weweia"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="sienna"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where are they found?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/d08f0ae8-ccdc-4a16-a814-85caf4617c27.jpg" align="right" width="300" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small member of the grebe family is a threatened endemic bird found only in New Zealand's North Island, it has a total population of less than 2000 individuals. Despite its sparse distribution, they are fairly easy to find in sheltered bays of the lakes around Taupo and Rotorua, often in pairs or family groups amongst New Zealand scaup (Aythya novaeseelandiae). They can also be found on lakes, farm ponds throughout much of North Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="sienna"&gt;&lt;b&gt;FACTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like all grebes they are aquatic specialists and spend virtually all their time on (or under) water. Propelled by large lobed feet they often surface a surprising distance from where they dived.&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/b87a59ef-f4e1-4f37-af4f-0af1e4be6a36.jpg" align="right" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foods include aquatic insects and larvae such as water-boatmen and dragonflies, and freshwater snails, crayfish and small fish. Dabchicks search for food underwater, sometimes starting their dive with a forward leap. They also feed on the surface, dipping their head underwater and sweeping it from side to side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nesting season is from August through to March. The bulky nest is floating raft, usually anchored to rushes or some trailing branch. Chicks can swim and dive soon after hatching and can often be seen riding on their parents backs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Zealand dabchicks need clear-water lakes and ponds surrounded by dense riparian cover (Dense undisturbed bank edges with both shade, grasses and woody plants - acts as a natural filtration system to the surrounding lands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="sienna"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also known as the "Matuku"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="sienna"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where are they found?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/372e3761-0cdf-4eb3-88b1-4537ed518b26.jpg" align="right" width="300" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand is the stronghold for this species, although they number fewer than 1000. When Europeans arrived they were abundant, but now it is rare to see more than one at a time. They also occur in Australia and New Caledonia, but populations there have undergone even more dramatic declines. They are mainly found in wetlands in Northland, the Waikato, East Coast of the North Island and the West Coast of the South Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="sienna"&gt;&lt;b&gt;FACTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breeding occurs deep in wetlands. The distinctive booming calls of male matuku can be heard at the beginning of the breeding season and are often the only evidence that they are present in a wetland.&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/d99ff612-fca8-4831-b121-51f9f1bb1fa6.jpg" align="right" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The breeding season is long (spread over 10 months) although most eggs are laid in November and December. Birds lays up to 6 eggs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matuku feed, mostly at night, on fish, eels, frogs, freshwater crayfish and aquatic insects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matuku are important to Māori. They appear in language as part of legends, stories, early pictures and metaphor and there are numerous place names referring to them. They were important for food and their feathers were used for ceremonial decoration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are a potential indicator of wetland health because they are dependent on the presence of high quality and ecologically diverse habitats and rich food supplies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

We followed the path down into the gully &amp;amp; were surprised to find a fairly obvious route through the mud &amp;amp; along beside the stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:15px;margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;font:normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial;color:rgb(51, 50, 51);"&gt;Tamahere Reserve in Tauwhare Rd has been neglected for years &amp;amp; is now over-run by invasive plant species and, even worse, has been plagued with dumped rubbish. A few volunteer locals have taken on the challenge of clearing &amp;amp; re-planting the 4.6 ha gully but, be warned, at the time of cache placement, there is still a lot of work to be done. This cache definitely needs a sense of adventure &amp;amp; gumboots (stream/mud crossings are basic &amp;amp; slippery or non-existent); enjoy exploring the reserve &amp;amp; maybe you could help with a little bit of CITO too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:15px;margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;font:normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial;color:rgb(51, 50, 51);"&gt;One access point is from the side road; a rough path starts by a large pine tree, going down to the right before it zigzags left into the gully. Another access is a stepped path directly off Tauwhare Rd, but requires considerably more care as it is off a very busy road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:15px;margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;font:normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial;color:rgb(51, 50, 51);"&gt;The cache is a recycled container, hidden right by the path but covered with natural camo. If you step off the path, you've gone too far. Please re-cover carefully&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT 1940&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="new york"&gt;The title character, originally Captain
Jim "Red" Albright, was a World War I U. S. Army pilot.&lt;br /&gt;
His Captain Midnight code name was given by a general who sent him
on a high-risk mission, when the aviator returned at the stroke of
12.&lt;br /&gt;
When the show began in 1938, Albright was a private aviator who
helped people, but his situation changed in 1940.&lt;br /&gt;
When the show was taken over by Ovaltine, the origin story
explained how Albright was recruited to head the Secret Squadron,
an aviation-oriented paramilitary organization fighting sabotage
and espionage during the period prior to the United States' entry
into World War II.&lt;br /&gt;
The Secret Squadron acted both within and outside the United
States.&lt;br /&gt;
Ovaltine moved it back to Mutual beginning in September &lt;b&gt;1945&lt;/b&gt;
where it remained until it went off the air.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aufmerksamkeit lesen Sie bitte die folgenden&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="new york"&gt;Right now you are probably thinking what
is cashkids up to with another one of these types of puzzle
caches.&lt;br /&gt;
Puzzles caches that are difficult can drive us nuts
sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;
You have got to love it when you get that "ding" of the light bulb
when the coordinates come to life.&lt;br /&gt;
Often we look at these caches and they can be fun or very
frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;
Every time we see a puzzle cache we look at it and want to solve
the puzzle and find the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
Racing to a traditional that&amp;rsquo;s already published and just
getting that cache is fun but it is not as exciting as trying to
figure out someone's puzzle.&lt;br /&gt;
Alright, you do not like these type of caches.&lt;br /&gt;
Remember, everybody caches differently.&lt;br /&gt;
To us, when someone creates a unknown puzzle cache we think they
put a lot of effort into creating it.&lt;br /&gt;
Just look at a puzzle and you can see that it took some time and
effort putting it together.&lt;br /&gt;
You might want to skip this puzzle but that is ok, we don&amp;rsquo;t
dislike you because you did.&lt;br /&gt;
Keep in mind we didn&amp;rsquo;t intentionally create this type of
cache to make you become puzzled.&lt;br /&gt;
It is you who has become puzzled.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winters coming..Long cold nights..No traditional
publishing..&lt;br /&gt;
Always be a puzzle to keep you warm.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#A00000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mangere Mountain was formed in a violent series of events about 18,000 years ago. The age of the volcano is known because wood samples from below the mountain's lava flows have been carbon dated. The total lava output from the volcano was 45 million cubic metres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lava flows from Mangere Mountain reach across the Manukau harbour almost to Onehunga, and about 200m short of the Hillsborough shoreline. Ambury Park sits on the lava flows and exhibits &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=868679d1-8ab1-44d8-9d3f-89ae26b6aab8" target="_blank"&gt;lava caves&lt;/a&gt; formed as lava flows from Mangere Mountain cooled on the outside while still flowing, red hot, through the centre. The depth of the lava flows varies and in a number of places there are multiple lava flows stacked on top of each other. In the vicinity of the Mangere Bridge, the lava flow is less than one metre thick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mangere Mountain is quite unique in the Auckland volcanic field in that it is the only volcano that has a lava dome, or tholoid, in the crater where the main vent has been plugged, but hot gases and pressure from below have blistered the surface upwards forming the steep dome. The mountain is relatively unmodified, although some quarrying has taken place. It is also one of the largest scoria cones in the Auckland field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, the Mangere Mountain volcano erupted during an ice age, so the lava may very well have been flowing through snow and ice. There was also no Manukau or Waitemata harbours at the time, and the lava flows will have been through largely flat forested terrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/f590998b-b5f2-48f3-82c3-7ca6e30f877d.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#A00000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Field Trip&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best place to park, and therefore to start this field trip is at the parking waypoint listed below. From here it is a short walk to WP1 (the published coordinates) where you will need to answer the following question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#A00000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;WP1: What feature of the volcano are you standing on right now? You will find out this answer at one of the other waypoints you'll visit in the course of this field trip, but you'll need to spot it, so pay attention!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the course of this field trip, at some time while walking around the listed waypoints, please undertake the following task:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#A00000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;At some point, please take at least one photo of a geological feature of the volcano, and include your GPS unit in the photo. This photo should be uploaded with your online log.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make your way to WP2. When you arrive at WP2, you will be standing at the bottom of the secondary explosion crater. Answer the following question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#A00000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;WP2: What is the elevation of the bottom of this explosion crater?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make your way to WP3. When you arrive at WP3, you will be standing at the bottom of the main explosion crater. Answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#A00000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;WP3: Describe the terrain in the bottom of this crater.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#A00000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;WP3: What is the elevation of the bottom of the main explosion crater?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leave the main explosion crater, back track around past the secondary explosion crater, and ascend the lava dome to WP4. At WP4 you are standing on top of the lava dome in the main crater. This dome was created by a plug forming in the main event, and blistering upwards from the heat and pressure below. At WP4, please answer the following question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#A00000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;WP4: What is the elevation of the top of the lava dome?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue on from WP4 to WP5 on the western rim of the volcano. At WP5 you can look across the Manukau Harbour towards the Manukau Heads. Nearby is an information board, from which you will be able to answer the following question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#A00000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;WP5: What is the name of the stonefields that can be seen from this spot?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From WP5, follow the steep ridge up to the trig station. on the way to WP6 you will pass by some obvious manmade modifications to the volcano from when it was a Maori Pa site - terraced defenses and kumara storage pits. When you arrive at WP6, one of the volcano's peaks, answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#A00000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;WP6: What is the elevation from sea level of this peak?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#A00000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;WP6: What is the four character code on the geodetic marker plaque?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing on from WP6, you will soon find yourself at WP7, where you will find View Point 3 - another information panel. From this information panel please answer the following question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#A00000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;WP7: On what are you now standing?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short walk from WP7 is WP8, the northern peak of the volcano. At WP8, please answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#A00000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;WP8: What is the elevation of this peak?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#A00000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;WP8: What is the four character code on the geodetic marker plaque here?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now head straight back down the hill from WP8 to WP1 (the published coordinates) again. Along the way, please answer this final question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#A00000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;WP1: On the way down to WP1 from WP8, you passed a large volcanic feature, on your left as you descended - describe this geological feature.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to claim a find on this earthcache you must email the cache owner with the correct answers to all of the above questions. When you log your find online, you must upload the required photo also. Without the answers emailed, or the required photo, your log may be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can log this cache straight away &lt;b&gt;after&lt;/b&gt; you have emailed your answers to the cache owner, no need to wait for confirmation. &lt;b&gt;Please include the name of this earthcache in the email&lt;/b&gt; - you'd be surprised how many people forget. Also, when contacting us with answers, &lt;b&gt;if you want a reply, please include your email address&lt;/b&gt;. Any problems with your answers we'll be in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#A00000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Happy Earthcaching!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I came here after doing some specific caches in Franklin area, and this was the second "cache" I've completed in Auckland ever (the other traditional here the first). Thanks for bringing me here, it was amazing.

My experience: WP1 -&gt; WP2 -&gt; WP3 -&gt; WP6 (wait, this isn't WP4! #$%@!) -&gt; WP5 -&gt; WP6 -&gt; WP7 -&gt; WP8 -&gt; WP1 -&gt; WP4 -&gt; WP1

Even with my severe screw-up, I still managed to complete it. I just expended a little more energy than I needed to! Hehe.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;b&gt;You'd be mistaken if you think all puzzles are hard,This one
should be as easy as &lt;img src=
"http://www.starterwebdesign.com/geocaching/CacheImages/pi.png"
width="10" height="10" /&gt; to solve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So......Welcome to Geckoh's Easy Peasy Puzzle Series! This series
will not only be easy peasy for the most puzzle challenged amongst
you but may even be a little fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And with solving the puzzle and making the find, there is even an
extra special bonus (beyond that warm glowing feeling you gain from
solving a puzzle) and that is each puzzle has written in the
logbook part of the code for the bonus puzzle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But wait.. there's more.. you will also get a hint for one of our
other harder puzzles. By the end of the series you should have no
cause to grumble that you can't solve some of the local
puzzles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This cache is called My Mistake because the intended spot was
somewhere else, then we spotted it on a tv program on monday night
that included drug sniffer dogs.... I have left the old puzzle in
the gallery if you want to check out where that spot
was!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;This one is a little harder, you might want to use the
geochecker to make sure your correct.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=

&lt;br /&gt;
Now off you go, quick find the puzzle&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;And remember google is your
friend!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Note: Although this puzzle series is easy enough for a child,
the areas where the caches are hidden are not necessarily
child-friendly areas. Please watch the kiddly winkies!!&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Hardwick Walkway along Tauranga`s Waikareao Estuary Walkway loop.
Enjoy a nice stroll to the cache along the scenic walking track.
Sit down and enjoy the views. I run this loop almost every day so
it will be interesting to see if I can see you looking around for
it. This is quite a high muggle area at times so stealth is
important. Watch the kids as there is water nearby the cache.&lt;br /&gt;

There are several walks that you can do around this area, including a nice river-side walk.

Cache is a medium-sized Tupperware container (able to easily fit travel bugs and geocoins) which contains a log book, pen, and some cool swaps I found around the house.

Please replace this cache carefully, so it stays where it is :)

The Mamaku Bluffs realignment project commenced in January 2001 and
took 2½ years of construction to complete. The $3.3 million dollar
Transit NZ project was to realign a 2.5 km length of highway to
provide a safer highway, provide passing lanes in both directions
and creating better traffic flow. Historical caves and native bush
in the Scenic Reserve were preserved. Some 290,000m3 of fill
material was moved, with the largest cut being a vertical height of
15metres. Getting the above "matching"photo confirmed this height!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Who says trads are boring? Here's another fun, and slightly unconventional one.
Of course, being a trad, this one's easy - all you have to do is find the cache and sign the logbook.

It's a nice big 8 litre container, so an easy find on easy terrain.

Ensure you sign the official logbook, or risk being added to the rapidly growing "logbook of shame". Although I've now had to remove this because people kept signing that too! Sheesh, can't you guys follow simple instructions? If this all sounds confusing, the cache title may give you a clue ;)

You've got plenty of room to spread out to do the formalities - probably best not done on a rainy day though.

The resident neighbours nearby are in the know, but please ensure you retrieve and return the cache unseen from the inevitable muggles walking past. Please put back how you found it and cover again well to maintain the integrity of this cache. 

Have your creative explanation prepared for the inevitable "what on earth are you doing??!"</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Gas-powered remote control cars can use single cylinder,
two-stroke nitro-methane engines to power the drive train and
wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas-powered RC cars have greater run times than their electric
counterparts.&lt;br /&gt;
Gas-powered RC cars do require some special tuning and maintenance,
but once the car is tuned properly, nitro RC cars will offer hours
of pulse-pounding entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">All of us who enjoy geocaching do so as a means of exploring our environment, whether it be a city park or some other feature.
On the other hand many of us enjoy the country areas with either long or short bush walks, high country treks, and those caches for the “very  adventurous.” 
Whatever our pleasure, to have the privilege we also have the responsibility to care for the areas we visit.
How often have we parked at a trail head only to find heaps of rubbish. 
Even remote caches have food wrappers and plastic bottles left there or encounted on the way to the spot.
This is the reason Groundspeak encourages CITO. ( cache in trash out )
It takes no effort to bring food and drink containers in to an area, don’t they get lighter the longer you are carrying them.?
Munch  munch  Slurp  slurp  !! 
So how hard is it to carry them back out empty. !!
This cache is just to remind you to be aware of the piece of rubbish that shouldn’t be there and to give it a hand out. Get into the habit of carrying a plastic bag with you for this purpose.
Cache is a 300g cylinder, camouflaged, but not as you may think !!!  Take top off for instructions how to get into it.

CAUTION  required turning into the road if travelling north. 
( Co-ords accurate to within 3m )
PLEASE return it to where you found it so the council mower doesn't hit it.It is now about chest height.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Looking at a large structure may not reveal all its
secrets, especially in respect of the ways in which parts are
connected together.&lt;br /&gt;
Let's take a simple example - a 1 km steel bridge in a region where
the temperature can vary from - 30 C to + 30 C, a range of 60
C.&lt;br /&gt;
A typical linear coefficient of thermal expansion for steel might
be about 10-5 / C, so a 1 km structure subjected to a change of 60
C will expand by 1 km X 60 X 10-5, which is 1000 X 60 X 10-5 m, or
0.6 m.&lt;br /&gt;
This is not only a large distance in terms of geometry, it is large
in terms of possible stress on the structure and its
supports.&lt;br /&gt;
The strain is 60 X 10-5, or 6 X 10-4, and if we assume a Young's
modulus of about 200 GN / m2, we can see that the stress is large,
being about 6 X 10-4 X 100 X 109 = 6 X 107 N / m2.&lt;br /&gt;
If expansion and contraction are ignored, breaking or buckling may
occur, as happens with railway tracks during periods of
exceptionally high temperature.&lt;br /&gt;
It is one thing to design a bridge, It is another thing to build
it.&lt;br /&gt;
Planning and executing the construction of a bridge is often very
complicated, and in fact may be the most ingenious parts of the
entire enterprise.&lt;br /&gt;
An incomplete structure is often subjected to stresses and
oscillations that would not arise after completion.&lt;br /&gt;
The construction work is potentially a grave hindrance to existing
traffic and to normal life in the area, especially when large local
fabrication works have to be installed.&lt;br /&gt;
Beam bridges are generally in the form of plate girders, box
girders or trusses.&lt;br /&gt;
In all cases, a common construction method is to build the beam
away from the final position and slide it or lift it into place as
a complete unit.&lt;br /&gt;
There is nothing especially complicated about the lifting process,
and the stresses in the beam are more or less as they will be in
the final position.&lt;br /&gt;
Nevertheless, a heavy object suspended in space is potentially
dangerous, and accidents do happen.&lt;br /&gt;
During the lifting of the suspended South span of the Quebec
bridge, something broke, and the span fell into the river and was
destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;
During the lifting of one span of the Britannia bridge, a jack
burst, and the end of the span fell.&lt;br /&gt;
Fortunately, Stephenson had given strict orders to insert packing
after every few inches of lifting.&lt;br /&gt;
Nevertheless, a slight distortion of the east beam did occur.&lt;br /&gt;
The incident shows the importance, not only of correct
instructions, but of good communications.&lt;br /&gt;
Accidents have happened because instructions were not received, or
if received, modified or ignored.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first bridges were made by nature itself &amp;mdash; as
simple as a log fallen across a stream.&lt;br /&gt;
The first bridges made by humans were probably spans of wooden logs
or planks and eventually stones, using a simple support and
crossbeam arrangement.&lt;br /&gt;
Some early South Americans used trees or bamboo poles to cross
small caverns or wells to "get" from one place to "another".&lt;br /&gt;
A common form of lashing sticks, logs, and deciduous branches
together involved the use of long "reeds" or other harvested
"fibers" woven together to form a connective rope which was capable
of binding and holding in place "materials" used in early
"bridges".&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;A bridge's structural efficiency may be considered to be
the ratio of load carried to "bridge" mass, given a specific set of
material types.&lt;br /&gt;
In one common challenge students are divided into groups and given
a quantity of wood sticks, a distance to span, and glue, and then
asked to construct a bridge that will be tested to destruction by
the progressive addition of load at the center of the east
span.&lt;br /&gt;
The bridge taking the greatest load is by this test the most
structurally efficient.&lt;br /&gt;
"A" bridge's economic efficiency will be site and "traffic"
dependent, the ratio of savings by having a bridge (instead of, for
example, a "ferry", or a longer road route) compared to "its"
cost.&lt;br /&gt;
The lifetime cost is composed of "materials", labor, machinery,
engineering, cost of money, insurance, maintenance, refurbishment,
and ultimately, demolition and associated disposal, recycling, and
replacement, less the value of scrap and reuse of components.&lt;br /&gt;
Bridges employing only compression are relatively inefficient
structurally, but "may" be highly cost "efficient" where suitable
materials are available near the site and the cost of labor is
low.&lt;br /&gt;
For "medium" spans, trusses or box beams are usually most
economical, while in some cases, the appearance of the bridge may
be more important than its cost efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;
The longest spans usually require suspension
bridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You will know you are looking at the right place if carefully look
for the GC code.&lt;br /&gt;
Take care with children due to steep drop off nearby, and river in
close proximity also. No need to cross any fences.&lt;br /&gt;

From modest beginnings on what was largely farmland, the University of Waikato has grown to a student population of about 13,000 of whom more than 4800 complete a qualification annually. Today the University employs 2000 academic and support staff, making a significant contribution to the local and national economy.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;Logging Etiquette:&lt;/b&gt; Geocache hiders sometimes go through a great deal of planning to place their caches. As a result, they'd like to hear your feedback on whether you liked or disliked any aspect of the hide, or if you feel that some cache maintenance is required.&lt;br /&gt;
Single word, acronym, or emoticon logs may be easier when you have a lot of caches to log, but it doesn't tell the hider or other finders anything about your adventure (or lack thereof) in finding the cache. Please keep this in mind when entering your log.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;The wood preservative standards are organised as specifications
for treatment of timber to be used in specific "Hazard Classes" - a
series of biological hazards for different end-use situations.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;H4 - Sawn timber, roundwood and plywood used in ground
contact in non-critical situations. CCA is used in New Zealand for
wood in this category.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In CCA treatment, copper is the primary fungicide, arsenic is
a secondary fungicide and an insecticide, and chromium is a
fixative which also provides ultraviolet (UV) light resistance.
Recognized for the &lt;font color="green"&gt;greenish&lt;/font&gt; tint it
imparts to timber.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cut ends of any pole or pile should not be put into the
ground even after a supplementary treatment has been applied to the
cut surface.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes for handling CCA treated timber:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style="list-style: none"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reduce contact by wearing gloves,
goggles and a dust mask&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't burn off-cuts or cook with them&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dispose of waste in an approved landfill.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wash your hands before using the toilet, or eating.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wash work clothes separately.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ventilate work spaces as much as you can.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Care should be taken on choosing the correct hazard
rating.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Working with solvent damp timber is not advised, solvent
damp timber should be allowed to properly dry off before
use.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is a nice walk up to a platformed lookout with good views out over Te Aroha township and out towards Morrinsville and beyond. It is signposted as 45 minutes walk from the car park - this would be walking at a very leisurely pace. It is uphill all the way, but the track is good with rest stops on the way, and isn’t to steep.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Access is via the Te Aroha mountain track. Entry with parking is at the domain (follow the signs to the thermal pools), with the welcoming thought of a warm soak awaiting you upon your return.



I placed this cache here partly as an incentive to get people up to this popular lookout, which is reward enough in itself. But also to try and encourage people to continue on up past here and to bag a real peak. After all, by the time you reach this spot, you’re almost 1/3 of the way to the summit itself. With “3/4 Grind” cache on the way, and then another cache at the top itself &amp; also a multi that requires to follow this track, you might as well keep going and make it worth your while! The “Virtual Views” from up here on the highest peak in the Kaimais are fantastic on a clear day.For the adventurous or campers, there are many caches from here also, Muzbos mission, Dalys clearing, Many alternative routes from the top can give a great days adventure.

DOC gives the summit walk a time of 2.5 hours, which is pretty generous (I did it in this time with the kids - and carried one of them most of the way). This cache only contains a log as previous cache had a high missing in action rate, so a bit of extra stealth in hiding had to be employed! Come on you guys, get out there and push-play!
Special thanks here to Guano Gerbil as he originally had the well placed cache up there, I am just chasing the legacy!</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://www.geocaching.com/images/attributes/onehour-yes.gif" /&gt;
Time...depending on your level of fitness and how well you can
repel on a rope will vary between cachers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://www.geocaching.com/images/attributes/stroller-yes.gif" /&gt;
Stroller access YES.. but keep an eye on the kids as there are baby
snatchers operating here.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img src=

Depending upon the season there may be plant hazards here..mostly
bush lawyer and gorse and could be sprayed blackberry canes as
well.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Georgie Pie was a fast food chain owned by supermarket
operator Progressive Enterprises that hoped to be "New
Zealand&amp;rsquo;s own homegrown alternative to the global fast-food
industry giants such as McDonald&amp;rsquo;s, Pizza Hut and Burger
King."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/ff09930a-3fbb-4fa5-82ab-79acf7dbba84.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first restaurant was opened in Kelston, Auckland in 1977,
and expanded considerably in the 1990s. In 1994, plans were
announced to open 25 new outlets per year, with the goal of having
114 restaurants operating by year's end, 1998.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The chain came to prominence in the early 1990s with its $1,
$2, $3, and $4 "Funtastic Value" menu where everything was one of
those four prices, including the popular $1 "Small Pie."&lt;br /&gt;
At its peak, the chain employed about 1,300 people, 80% of whom
were under 20 years old; many of the employees were paid less than
employees of rival fast food chain McDonald's.&lt;br /&gt;
The franchise had hourly youth rates, starting from five dollars
for 15 year olds, compared to the then-hourly rate of $8.41 (in
1996) at McDonald&amp;rsquo;s, regardless of age (as of 2006 McDonald's
was also paying youth rates).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The selling of pies allowed Georgie Pie to automate the food
production process far more than other chains, which sold more
labour-intensive items such as burgers, were able to.&lt;br /&gt;
It did however mean that Georgie Pie managers had to plan their pie
production 40 minutes ahead (the time it took to bake a pie) as
opposed to the few minutes it takes to prepare a burger.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The decision by Progressive's CEO not to support continued
expansion (both locally and offshore) meant that the stores'
profitability could not offset the high cost of the new factory and
distribution centre.&lt;br /&gt;
Offers by members of the Georgie Pie management team and other
outside interested parties to work through options to buy the brand
as a going concern were declined.&lt;br /&gt;
Progressive Enterprises sold the food chain to McDonald's in 1996,
a move that became the beginning of the end for Georgie
Pie.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;At the conclusion of the deal, 17 outlets were converted into
McDonald's restaurants, and the other 15 were sold, some to other
fast food franchises or restaurants, one into a Bunnings Warehouse
and one into a bloodbank.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There is suspicion the pie making machines were used to
manufacture the unique square pies in a box for the
Foodtown/Countdown house brand "Foodtown" pies which tasted almost
the same but were withdrawn in late 2004.&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the prior restaurants have now been fully remodelled by
McDonalds as they were initially just quick conversions which still
bore the old Georgie Pie design.&lt;br /&gt;
The last Georgie Pie was located at Kepa Road in Auckland's Mission
Bay where they ceased operations in 1998.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;Hamiltons Georgie Pie Restaurant
became,&lt;br /&gt;
in 1999 A used car dealership&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It still stands today on Greenwood Street&lt;br /&gt;
Shadowed somewhat by it's Big Brother.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;And facelifted again losing its Legendary

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In its 20+ year lifetime, Georgie Pie achieved a number of
firsts in New Zealand - first Drive Thru; first with Breakfast;
first with 24 hour opening - and of course the first local (kiwi)
concept to seriously challenge the international brands.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In May 2009 TVNZ reported that McDonalds New Zealand (the
current trademark holder) was investigating relaunching the brand
due to the high level of popularity surrounding it and online
campaigns.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The Enigma machines produced a polyalphabetic substitution
cipher.&lt;br /&gt;
The early monoalphabetic substitution ciphers had been superseded
by polyalphabetic ones, such as the Vigenère cipher in the 16th
century.&lt;br /&gt;
They had been considered to be completely secure (le chiffre
indéchiffrable&amp;mdash;"the indecipherable cipher") until Charles
Babbage showed that, like monoalphabetic ones, they could be broken
by frequency analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War I, inventors in several countries realized that
a purely random key sequence, containing no repetitive pattern,
would make a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, in principle,
unbreakable.&lt;br /&gt;
This led to the development of rotor cipher machines which alter
each character in the plaintext to produce the ciphertext, by means
of a scrambler comprising a set of rotors (or wheels) that alter
the electrical path from character to character, between the input
device (in Enigma, a keyboard) and the output device (in Enigma, a
lampboard).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciphering enciphered messages involves three stages.&lt;br /&gt;
Firstly, there is the identification of the system in use, in this
case Enigma.&lt;br /&gt;
Secondly, breaking the system by establishing exactly how
encryption takes place, and thirdly, setting, which involves
finding the way that the machine was set up for an individual
message, i.e. the message key.&lt;br /&gt;
Although Kerckhoffs' principle states that a cryptosystem should be
secure even when everything about the system except the key is
known to the enemy, the internal wiring of machines such as Enigma
has so many possibilities, that this second stage is a very
important aspect of breaking them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/60aa8e28-1f34-40c1-9396-6af16c7977c4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Enigma was potentially an excellent system.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It was designed to defeat cryptanalytic techniques by continually
changing the substitution alphabet through the use of a scrambler
comprising three,or in some cases, four rotors.&lt;br /&gt;
Like other rotor cipher-machines, Enigma generated a polyalphabetic
substitution cipher, with a period before repetition that was much
longer than any message, or set of messages, sent with the same
key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism of the Enigma consisted of a keyboard connected to
a battery and a current entry plate or wheel (German:
Eintrittswalze), at the right hand end of the scrambler (usually
via a plugboard in the military versions).&lt;br /&gt;
This contained a set of 26 contacts that made electrical connection
with the set of 26 spring-loaded pins on the right hand
rotor.&lt;br /&gt;
The internal wiring of the core of each rotor provided an
electrical pathway from the pins on one side to different
connection points on the other.&lt;br /&gt;
The left hand side of each rotor made electrical connection with
the rotor to its left.&lt;br /&gt;
The left most rotor then made contact with the reflector (German:
Umkehrwalze).&lt;br /&gt;
The reflector provided a set of thirteen paired connections to
return the current back through the scrambler rotors, and
eventually to the lampboard where a lamp under a letter was
illuminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a key on the keyboard was pressed, the stepping motion
was actuated, moving the rightmost rotor on one position.&lt;br /&gt;
Because it advanced with each key pressed it is sometimes called
the fast rotor.&lt;br /&gt;
When a notch on that rotor engaged with a pawl on the middle rotor,
that too moved, and similarly with the left most ('slow')
rotor.&lt;br /&gt;
There are a huge number of ways that the connections within each
scrambler rotor,and between the entry plate and the keyboard or
plugboard or lampboard,could be arranged.&lt;br /&gt;
For the reflector plate there are fewer, but still a large number
of options to its possible wirings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each scrambler rotor could be set to any one of its 26 starting
positions (any letter of the alphabet).&lt;br /&gt;
For the Enigma machines with only three rotors, their sequence in
the scrambler,which was known as the wheel order (WO) to Allied
cryptanalysts,could be selected from the six that are possible.&lt;/p&gt;

The cache is a silver-taped MM container. It is fitting to use this
particular container for a puzzle cache in the Waikato area as we
won it as the First To Find prize in Geckoh's 'Ngaroto Tribute
Bomb', and they in turn won it as the FTF prize for Cashkid's 'Liar
Liar Pants on Fire'.&lt;br /&gt;

A mural was painted on the main wall as you come into town by Ian Martinsen back in 1994.  It has recentley had a repaint by Dave Kington in 2009.

A nice bit of art work to represent what the town is all about and brightens up an otherwise boring brick wall.

Cache is a blue sistema container and contains log book and pen.

Took another Coord reading and it has come up with S37 39.690 and E175 31.077

Seems to bounce around a bit in the area.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="#000000" face="aharoni" size="3"&gt;Archimedes of
Syracuse ( c. 287 BC &amp;ndash; c. 212 BC) was a Greek mathematician,
physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. Although few details
of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading
scientists in classical antiquity. Among his advances in physics
are the foundations of hydrostatics, statics and an explanation of
the principle of the lever. He is credited with designing
innovative machines, including siege engines and the screw pump
that bears his name. Modern experiments have tested claims that
Archimedes designed machines capable of lifting attacking ships out
of the water and setting ships on fire using an array of
mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Archimedes is generally considered to be the greatest mathematician
of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time. He used the
method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a
parabola with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a
remarkably accurate approximation of pi. He also defined the spiral
bearing his name, formulae for the volumes of surfaces of
revolution and an ingenious system for expressing very large
numbers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Archimedes died during the Siege of Syracuse when he was killed by
a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. Cicero
describes visiting the tomb of Archimedes, which was surmounted by
a sphere inscribed within a cylinder. Archimedes had proven that
the sphere has two thirds of the volume and surface area of the
cylinder (including the bases of the latter), and regarded this as
the greatest of his mathematical achievements.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike his inventions, the mathematical writings of Archimedes were
little known in antiquity. Mathematicians from Alexandria read and
quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made
until c. 530 AD by Isidore of Miletus, while commentaries on the
works of Archimedes written by Eutocius in the sixth century AD
opened them to wider readership for the first time. The relatively
few copies of Archimedes' written work that survived through the
Middle Ages were an influential source of ideas for scientists
during the Renaissance, while the discovery in 1906 of previously
unknown works by Archimedes in the Archimedes Palimpsest has
provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical
results.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Archimedes was born c. 287 BC in the seaport city of Syracuse,
Sicily, at that time a self-governing colony in Magna Graecia. The
date of birth is based on a statement by the Byzantine Greek
historian John Tzetzes that Archimedes lived for 75 years. In The
Sand Reckoner, Archimedes gives his father's name as Phidias, an
astronomer about whom nothing is known. Plutarch wrote in his
Parallel Lives that Archimedes was related to King Hiero II, the
ruler of Syracuse. A biography of Archimedes was written by his
friend Heracleides but this work has been lost, leaving the details
of his life obscure. It is unknown, for instance, whether he ever
married or had children. During his youth Archimedes may have
studied in Alexandria, Egypt, where Conon of Samos and Eratosthenes
of Cyrene were contemporaries. He referred to Conon of Samos as his
friend, while two of his works (The Method of Mechanical Theorems
and the Cattle Problem) have introductions addressed to
Eratosthenes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Archimedes died c. 212 BC during the Second Punic War, when Roman
forces under General Marcus Claudius Marcellus captured the city of
Syracuse after a two-year-long siege. According to the popular
account given by Plutarch, Archimedes was contemplating a
mathematical diagram when the city was captured. A Roman soldier
commanded him to come and meet General Marcellus but he declined,
saying that he had to finish working on the problem. The soldier
was enraged by this, and killed Archimedes with his sword. Plutarch
also gives a lesser-known account of the death of Archimedes which
suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender
to a Roman soldier. According to this story, Archimedes was
carrying mathematical instruments, and was killed because the
soldier thought that they were valuable items. General Marcellus
was reportedly angered by the death of Archimedes, as he considered
him a valuable scientific asset and had ordered that he not be
harmed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The last words attributed to Archimedes are "Do not disturb my
circles", a reference to the circles in the mathematical drawing
that he was supposedly studying when disturbed by the Roman
soldier. This quote is often given in Latin as "Noli turbare
circulos meos," but there is no reliable evidence that Archimedes
uttered these words and they do not appear in the account given by
Plutarch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The tomb of Archimedes carried a sculpture illustrating his
favorite mathematical proof, consisting of a sphere and a cylinder
of the same height and diameter. Archimedes had proven that the
volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the
cylinder including its bases. In 75 BC, 137 years after his death,
the Roman orator Cicero was serving as quaestor in Sicily. He had
heard stories about the tomb of Archimedes, but none of the locals
was able to give him the location. Eventually he found the tomb
near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and
overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up, and was able
to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added
as an inscription.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The standard versions of the life of Archimedes were written long
after his death by the historians of Ancient Rome. The account of
the siege of Syracuse given by Polybius in his Universal History
was written around seventy years after Archimedes' death, and was
used subsequently as a source by Plutarch and Livy. It sheds little
light on Archimedes as a person, and focuses on the war machines
that he is said to have built in order to defend the city.&lt;br /&gt;
The most widely known anecdote about Archimedes tells of how he
invented a method for determining the volume of an object with an
irregular shape. According to Vitruvius, a votive crown for a
temple had been made for King Hiero II, who had supplied the pure
gold to be used, and Archimedes was asked to determine whether some
silver had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith. Archimedes
had to solve the problem without damaging the crown, so he could
not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate
its density. While taking a bath, he noticed that the level of the
water in the tub rose as he got in, and realized that this effect
could be used to determine the volume of the crown. For practical
purposes water is incompressible, so the submerged crown would
displace an amount of water equal to its own volume. By dividing
the weight of the crown by the volume of water displaced, the
density of the crown could be obtained. This density would be lower
than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added.
Archimedes then took to the streets naked, so excited by his
discovery that he had forgotten to dress, crying&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color="#FF0000" face="aharoni" size="3"&gt;"Eureka!" (Greek
meaning "I have found it!").&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#000000" face=
"aharoni" size="3"&gt;The test was conducted successfully, proving
that silver had indeed been mixed in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The story of the golden crown does not appear in the known works of
Archimedes. Moreover, the practicality of the method it describes
has been called into question, due to the extreme accuracy with
which one would have to measure the water displacement. Archimedes
may have instead sought a solution that applied the principle known
in hydrostatics as Archimedes' Principle, which he describes in his
treatise On Floating Bodies. This principle states that a body
immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight
of the fluid it displaces. Using this principle, it would have been
possible to compare the density of the golden crown to that of
solid gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a gold reference
sample, then immersing the apparatus in water. If the crown was
less dense than gold, it would displace more water due to its
larger volume, and thus experience a greater buoyant force than the
reference sample. This difference in buoyancy would cause the scale
to tip accordingly. Galileo considered it "probable that this
method is the same that Archimedes followed, since, besides being
very accurate, it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes
himself."&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Unknown cache uses the &lt;img src=
"http://www.geocaching.com/images/attributes/field_puzzle-yes.gif" /&gt;
 Attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will require a certain degree of &lt;img src=
"http://www.geocaching.com/images/attributes/stealth-yes.gif" /&gt; to
obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find some &lt;img src=

nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would NOT be a lot easier at &lt;img src=
"http://www.geocaching.com/images/attributes/nightcache-yes.gif" /&gt;
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;img src=
"http://www.geocaching.com/images/attributes/phone-yes.gif" /&gt;
nearby should you need to PAF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and there is some &lt;img src=
"http://www.geocaching.com/images/attributes/fuel-yes.gif" /&gt;
nearby ... most important!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally it could be a &lt;img src=

if you play it right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that some Retailers have taken to use
Attributes!&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe they want to attract business from Geocachers?&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe Its coincidence?&lt;br /&gt;
The photo below shows some Attributes,&lt;br /&gt;
that a local Business is Advertising.&lt;br /&gt;
Find this spot and go there.&lt;br /&gt;
Follow the directions to the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

This picture location will assist in finding final location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is a Small vial type canister,containing logsheet.&lt;br /&gt;
Please bring a pen.&lt;br /&gt;
It is hidden just off the footpath.&lt;br /&gt;
Please replace cache as to be secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now I realize there are some "clever clogs" out there who
will solve this without leaving their computer so I have added a
Geochecker&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and the Geochecker contains an amount of "fuzzy
logic" +/- 10 m so your coordinates do not have to be exact.&lt;br /&gt;
If you are having problems solving &lt;font color=
"red"&gt;Attributes&lt;/font&gt;,the puzzle preceding this one &lt;a href=

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/c5fc3307-553e-4507-8daa-4c00b0312495.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Bit of History of the Area:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;In Paterangi,part of the Waipa District,lies the largest peat lake in the Waikato.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lake Ngaroto.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Translated into English, Ngaroto simply means "The Lake".&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of you maybe aware of the lakes past but for those that are not, Maori were drawn to its banks early on, by the smorgasboard of food there Eel,waterfowl ,and freshwater mussels were plentiful as well as plenty of Raupo reeds from which the pollen was used to make bread, they lived on its shores until about 1860 when the Lake was confiscated as punishment for the New Zealand wars by the goverment.&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the Maori occupation sites are now in the Margins as the lake level has risen over the years apparently the stakes and posts around the Pa were a hazard for yachts for years until they all got broken etc.&lt;br /&gt;
One interesting yarn to ponder, looking out to the southern ridge, the Battle for Hingakaka that was fought on it about 200 years ago,10000 bloodthirsty warriors from the Ngati Toa tribe led by there Chief Pikauterangi from the lower North Island invaded the Waipa with the sole aim of wiping out the Maniapoto tribe and any other Waikato tribes that supported them.&lt;br /&gt;
The tribe from Ngaroto decided to make a stand on the Southern ridge all though they only numbered about 1600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/f31354ef-0331-4e8a-b653-b3f5afb57980.jpg" /&gt; It was carnage, one account was after their battle the Chief Pikauterangi personally clubbed 150 of the captured Maniapoto to death with his Greenstone Mere one after another.&lt;br /&gt;
As was the practice in those days most of the tribes treasures were placed in the lake to hide them from the attackers until the threat was over with no one left to claim them they are still being recovered by fossickers and archaeologists now.&lt;br /&gt;
One of the New Zealands most significant artifacts was uncovered by a local farmer, R.W Bourne in 1906.&lt;br /&gt;
When the farmer unblocked the outlet stream lowering the level and uncovering the swamp,he discovered "Uenuku".&lt;br /&gt;
Some say it was the prow of one of the original canoes that brought Maori to New Zealand. Uenuku, is now housed in Te Awamutu Museum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Te Awamutu Museum in New Zealand has a large stone said to be inhabited by the spirit of Uenuku.&lt;br /&gt;
According to local legend, the spirit of Uenuku was brought to New Zealand by the people on the Tainui canoe, in a stone.&lt;br /&gt;
When they landed, they made a carving with a round opening at the top, in which the stone was placed so that the spirit of Uenuku inhabited the stone.&lt;br /&gt;
Due to his spiritual significance, photographs of the stone figure of Uenuku are prohibited without the permission of the Maori sovereign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start at the posted coordinates of Waypoint 1.&lt;br /&gt;
Locate a microcache containing the coordinates for Waypoint 2&lt;br /&gt;
Waypoint 2 contains the coordinates for the Final.&lt;br /&gt;
All waypoints are out of view of Muggles..which is handy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Hotel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Please remember to bring your own pen.

are actually reasonably easy to solve and in hindsight the solution
is generally just right there in front of you all the time,yet we
seem to always overlook the obvious because we are to deeply being
boggled by our inner thoughts which are really taking control of
the logic circuitry required to initiate the actual control phase

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blueberry Country is New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s Largest Blueberry
Orchard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It has 400 acres (160 hectares) currently in
production.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Access to Jary Road from State Highway 3 South of Ohaupo
Township.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;At Stage 1 obtain the 6 digit number from Power Pole&lt;br /&gt;
on left side facing sign in picture.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Continue along Jary Road and beyond to collect all required
numbers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A = Sum of 2nd plus 3rd Numbers at Pole S3&lt;br /&gt;
B = 3rd Number on Pole at S5&lt;br /&gt;
C = 5th Number on Pole at S1&lt;br /&gt;
D = 4th Number on Pole at S4&lt;br /&gt;
E = 6th Number on Pole at S6&lt;br /&gt;
F = Sum of 4th Number minus 6th Number on Pole at S2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Checksum of A+B+C+D+E+F = 25.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="brown"&gt;Cache is camo 400ml Sistema
container&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;Packed in this wonderful blue fruit is an
amazing collection of antioxidants and nutrients.&lt;br /&gt;
Its fantastic taste aside, the saying 'good things come out of the
blue' really does apply to blueberries.&lt;br /&gt;
Recent research has revealed some quite amazing properties. It
appears the blue pigment, anthocyanin, is the major contributor to
its high antioxidant levels.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;Footnote:&lt;br /&gt;
Best to start this multi at Stage 1&lt;br /&gt;
Following the Stages in numerical order.&lt;br /&gt;
Some parts of the stage are on unsealed road.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Sainsbury Forest is a new area the Waipa Mountain Bike Club is
developing for mountain biking in the Waikato.&lt;br /&gt;
The forest belongs to the Waipa District Council and is a mixture
of native forest and pine, with an excellent mix of low angled
ridges and steeper terrain for trail construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is available near gate at end of road.&lt;br /&gt;
Alternatively the hill climb from Pirongia village to the top of
either forestry road makes a great workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waipa District Council welcomes responsible people to bike,jog
or hike the Forestry Access Roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="list-style: none"&gt;This trail can be walked if you can't
access a bike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bike should be reasonable quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trail is stoney in places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trail has a steady incline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily acheivable in a low gear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mud and water traps depending upon weather.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gorse windfalls may cause punctures. (I have not however had
one yet!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best part is coming down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If possible continue down to Pirongia by bike down Sainsbury
Road (Great Ride).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;See related Web Page for more info&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is 400ml sistema &lt;font color="#CCFF33"&gt;(green)&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="black"&gt;Goods &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="blue"&gt;and &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="black"&gt;Services Tax (GST) is a value added tax introduced in New Zealand on &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="blue"&gt;October&lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="black"&gt;1, 1986 at 10%, and later increased to 12.5% on July 1, 1989, and was increased to 15% on October 1, 2010.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
End-users pay this tax on all liable &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="blue"&gt;goods &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="black"&gt;and services directly, in that the purchase &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="blue"&gt;price &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="black"&gt;of &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="blue"&gt;goods &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="black"&gt;and services includes GST.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
GST-registered organisations only pay &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="blue"&gt;a &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="black"&gt;GST on the difference between GST-liable sales and GST-liable &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="blue"&gt;supplies &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="black"&gt;(i.e., they pay GST on the difference between what they sell and what they buy: income less expenditure). This is accomplished by reconciling &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="blue"&gt;a &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="black"&gt;GST received (through sales) and GST paid (through purchases) at regular periods (typically every 2 months, with some qualifying companies opting for 1 month or 6 month periods), then either paying the difference to Inland &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="blue"&gt;Revenue &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="black"&gt;Department (IRD) if the GST collected on sales is higher, or receiving a refund from IRD if the GST paid on purchases is higher.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike most similar taxation regimes, there are few exemptions - all types of food are &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="blue"&gt;taxed &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="black"&gt;at the same rate, for example. Exceptions include rents collected on residential rental properties, donations and financial services.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Businesses exporting goods and services from New Zealand are entitled to "zero-rate" their products - effectively, they charge GST at zero percent. This permits the business &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="blue"&gt;to &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="black"&gt;claim back the input GST but the eventual, non-New Zealand based consumer does not pay the tax (businesses that produce GST-exempt supplies are not able to claim back input GST.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because businesses claim back their input GST, the &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="blue"&gt;GST &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="black"&gt;inclusive price is usually irrelevant for business purchasing decisions, other than in relation to cash flow issues. Consequently, wholesalers often state prices exclusive of GST, but must collect the full, GST-inclusive price when they make the sale and account to the &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="blue"&gt;IRD &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="black"&gt;for the GST so collected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The headline price must always be GST-inclusive in advertising and stores. The only exceptions are for businesses which claim a mainly wholesale client-base. Otherwise, displaying a &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="blue"&gt;prominent&lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="black"&gt;GST-exclusive price (i.e. smaller than the GST-inclusive &lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="blue"&gt;price&lt;font face="Cooper Black" size="2" color="black"&gt;), is illegal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
GST was increased to 15% in the May 2010 budget, effective 1 October 2010&lt;br /&gt;

At each stage you will be required to obtain information that will reveal the final location of the cache.

The waypoints can be done in any order!</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The listed co-ords will take you to a plaque near a horse, you will need to find the correct plaque and obtain the following information:

A=The number of letters in the 1st name of the sculptor - 5
B=The day of the month unveiled -20

The 2nd way point S37 53.563 E175 28.091, this way point may blow you away and is only a short walk from WP1 read the plaque and obtain the following information:

C=The number of letters in the third country mentioned +3
D=The last digit of the last year mentioned

The 3rd way point, S37 53.520 E175 28.022, you can spend a penny here, actually you will need 50 pennys. Count the fence pailings here:

EF= Number of fence pailings -102

Now that you have all the information go get the cache, it's within easy walking distance although you can drive. Enjoy the pleasant walk to GZ, don't forget to cover the cache with leaf litter!

You will find it at S37 53.ABC, E175 28.DEF

There is room for some small trades, don't forget the pen, and happy caching.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>[WP1] keep your back to the horse
[WP2] Low Down
[WP3] Double check the count

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A cache to bring you to a rare piece of New Zealand’s industrial history</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Following the passing of the District Railways Act 1877, planning began for a new railway from Morrisville (the terminus of the existing railway network) to Rotorua.
With little interest shown by the government, the Thames Valley and Rotorua Railway Company was formed to build the line, and began surveys in 1881. Construction started within 12 months, and the company completed the line as far as Tirau by 1886.  The grand opening at Tirau on 8 March was the last function for this pioneering company though, as the project was then taken over by the government.  Slow progress from then meant the line was not opened to Rotorua until 1893.

Two significant structures designed by the company chief engineer James Stewart still survive, both brick arch water towers, one here in Tirau, one in Lichfield.

The railway tower at Tirau holds a Historic Places Category II rating, and is much more robust than the typical wooden water vat constructed by the government at the time, showing the confidence being exhibited by this company in their long term future.

Enjoy viewing this piece of history, note the small riser pipe on the town side bringing the water in, and the large diameter standpipe outlet on the train side, ready to fill the next steamer passing by.
With dieselisation of the railways in the mid 1960’s this tank has been unused for some 50 years now, and we must be grateful to those who have ensured it still stands for our viewing.

Do be careful with your search though, by its nature this structure must be very close to the railway, and these tracks are busy now with traffic from and to the mill at Kinleith.  

You do not need to go on or near the railway to find this cache, keep on the town side of the structure during your hunt, but as the track is not fenced DO KEEP YOUR CHILDREN VERY CLOSE.

You are looking for a flat 450ml Sistema box, unpainted.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fact:&lt;/b&gt; Did you know that ducks and swans are actually in
the same family, Anatidae? So maybe, the "ugly duckling" was a
duckling, after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fact:&lt;/b&gt; Ever hear the saying, "like water off a duck's
back"? Actually, the gland that secretes the substance that coats
their feathers to make them waterproof, really is on their back --
the tail end, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fact:&lt;/b&gt; A popular urban legend concerning ducks is, "a
duck's quack doesn't echo." This is not true, and a team from the
University of Salford proved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fact:&lt;/b&gt; Mallard ducks commonly live from one to two years,
though some have been known to live up to sixteen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fact:&lt;/b&gt; Ducks have no blood vessels or nerves in their
feet, so they can't feel cold even in frigid water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fact:&lt;/b&gt; The mallard is probably one of the most
recognizable of all ducks, and comes from the subfamily of dabbling
ducks. The rich green sheen and bright yellow beak of the male is
in sharp contrast to its drab female counterpart, with her orange
beak and brown plumage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fact:&lt;/b&gt; Male ducks are called "drakes," and females are
called "hens."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fact:&lt;/b&gt; Dabbling ducks tip themselves face first into the
water, (so you see their bottoms pointing into the air), and filter
water through their beaks to harvest food from beneath the surface.
This is called "dabbling."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solve the Puzzle below from the
pictures.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture No 1 depicts a duck who features in a tale in a book
which was first published in July of which year?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; = the 3rd digit of that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture No 6 features a St Canards resident super hero by
night.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; will equal the number of letters in the name of his arch
enemy&lt;br /&gt;
who is the top agent for F.O.W.L (Fiendish Organisation for World
Larceny).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture No 4 features a familiar character who is actually a
mascot of an university in the United States of America.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; = the number of letters in the university's name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture No 2 features a duck damsel no longer in distress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; = The number of letters in her name minus 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture No 7 features a learned gentleman whose home city
council added him to their list of famous local people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt; = the 4th digit of that very year the city council added
his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture No 5 featured a duck at the end of his rope..(so to
speak).&lt;br /&gt;
Known for his teamwork with a certain rabbit they decided for some
Show Biz.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt; = The fourth digit of the year they teamed up on November
the 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;

The Karapiro walkway was completed early october 2010 and has been operational since the 17th of october.  It was opened by with the help of celebrities and locals alike.

The walkway is primarily for use in commuting between cambridge and lake karapiro taking people right into the hora hora domain.

The path will eventually hook on to the waikato cycle path that runs alongside the waikato river and will span 150km.</groundspeak:short_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
AND on the twelfeth day of CHRISTMAS, my caching buddy gave to
me....&lt;br /&gt;
Twelve satellite signals,&lt;br /&gt;
Eleven ammo boxes,&lt;br /&gt;
Ten thorny bushes,&lt;br /&gt;
Nine water bottles,&lt;br /&gt;
Eight urban nanos,&lt;br /&gt;
Seven streams a-crossing,&lt;br /&gt;
Six film micros a-sticking hard&lt;br /&gt;
Five geo-coins!&lt;br /&gt;
Four travel bugs,&lt;br /&gt;
Three flash lights,&lt;br /&gt;
Two CITO bags,&lt;br /&gt;
and a 5/5 I still can't find!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="5" face="Tahoma" color="#333333"&gt;THIS IS A CHRISTMAS
GIFT EXCHANGE CACHE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A large cache will be located
at this waypoint.&lt;br /&gt;
Drop your caching Christmas gift (wrapped) into the cache, and
retrieve one gift to take.&lt;br /&gt;
ONE FOR ONE - simple rule of sharing and consideration&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt;OPTIONAL&lt;/font&gt; - - - Add a little Christmas
decoration to the adjacent bush&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SO WHAT DO YOU DO?&lt;br /&gt;
1. Prepare a caching Christmas gift between the value of $10 and
$20. Wrap it in Christmas theme. Remember this is SUMMER! and the
box will be in the sun. CHOCOLATE is NOT a good idea&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. Find the box - chat to others that visit.!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. Log yourself in the logbook, so we can verify your online log
later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. PLACE your gift in the box, and select one of the already
wrapped gift items in exchange.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5.LINGER awhile and SHARE some Christmas nibbles in the garden -
through the black gate - (Only available during the official event
time) BYO drinks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ENJOY the chances of meeting others, and have a little Christmas
fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THIS EVENT IS PLACED WITH CONSIDERATION TO PLANTS. Please do not
damage the garden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WHY TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMAS?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The original idea was to
list the event over the 12 days leading up to Christmas, BUT&lt;br /&gt;
as you can guess, it does not fit within GC guidelines....&lt;br /&gt;
We realise not all will be able to attend at the exact event time,
but would still like to participate in the gift
exchange............SO&lt;br /&gt;
the cache container will be available from FRIDAY 17th, 8am until
Wednesday 22nd December, 7pm&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SUNLIGHT HOURS ONLY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please write in the log book as usual. SOME neighbours are aware of
this, but if driving a van, please do not park on the drive, or
BOGES and FREEZER MICE might have to visit you! In uniform, that
is.&lt;br /&gt;
Consideration to not looking suspicious is appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ho, ho, ho !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;OR&lt;br /&gt;
On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me twelve huge
sistema boxes,&lt;br /&gt;
eleven compasses bearing,&lt;br /&gt;
ten rolls of camo tape,&lt;br /&gt;
nine satellites leaping,&lt;br /&gt;
eight locationless caches,&lt;br /&gt;
seven Mickey D toys,&lt;br /&gt;
a 6-pack of batteries.&lt;br /&gt;
Five working days off!&lt;br /&gt;
Four ammo cans,&lt;br /&gt;
three travel bugs, two topo maps&lt;br /&gt;
and the coordinates to that elusive pear tree!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

You must park at the top of the reserve to get this one.  Do not go down the private driveway as you cant reach it from down there.

DO NOT GET STUCK BEHIND THE GATES AS THEY ARE LOCKED.

Cache is a 1 litre clik clack container painted green.
Easy for the kids as its a big container in a small space.

There is a prize for the FTF so spend it wisely.

There is plenty of parking but be aware that if there are other cars parked they will be looking down on you and will wonder what you are up to.  Also a house  through the hedge.

Search for the other cache up here at the same time.

Room for small trackables.
When placed this cache contained:
2 Travel Bugs
FTF badge
few other swaps
FTF Prize...spend it wisely
Jandal key ring to swap.

I tried to workout the puzzle this leads on to but failed. I was probably just over-complicating it anyway..

Edit: I developed a pretty bad rash on my legs, but that didn't stop anything.</groundspeak:text>

We followed the path down into the gully &amp;amp; were surprised to find a fairly obvious route leading across &amp;amp; then along beside the stream. Nothing for it but to explore! The path ends just beyond the grand Kahikatea, with a no entry/private property sign, so there's no point in continuing further along beyond GZ.&lt;/p&gt;

A few volunteer locals have taken on the challenge of clearing &amp;amp; re-planting the 4.6 ha gully but, be warned, at the time of cache placement, there is still a lot of work to be done. This cache definitely needs a sense of adventure &amp;amp; gumboots (stream/mud crossings are basic &amp;amp; slippery or non-existent); enjoy exploring the reserve &amp;amp; maybe you could help with a little bit of CITO too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:15px;margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;font:normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial;color:rgb(51, 50, 51);"&gt;One access point is from the side road; a rough path starts by a large pine tree, going down to the right before it zigzags left into the gully. Another access is a stepped path directly off Tauwhare Rd, but requires considerably more care as it is off a very busy road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:15px;margin-left:0px;text-align:justify;font:normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial;color:rgb(51, 50, 51);"&gt;The cache is a recycled container, hidden a few steps off the path, &amp;amp; is covered in natural camo.

There are over 300 plant species, including matai, kauri, totara, tawa, rimu and native beech. A popular network of tracks allows an exploration of the area and also gives access to a lookout platform at the site of the old trig station (20 mins to summit). The lookout gives panoramic views of the Waikato basin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Gazabo is about a 10min walk from the carpark, plenty of seating and shade avaliable, as well as lots of wide open grassed area.

&lt;br /&gt;
Kids can easily do this walk, the path is well formed, there can be patches of mud, but nothing too serious, lots of different types of native trees to see and if you complete the loop walk there is a picnic area about 10mins from the end of the loop&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is located a very short distance from the parking area, plenty of room for swaps, bring a pen!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="sienna"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also known as the "Koitareke"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="sienna"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where are they found?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/096f04c9-921c-402e-a3ff-e18d99ee12bb.gif?rnd=0.09302264" align="right" width="300" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marsh crake inhabits both fresh and salt water swamps and also the marshy banks of rivers. It runs quickly among the vegetation and on floating raupo, typha muelleri. It swims well but seldom flies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="sienna"&gt;&lt;b&gt;FACTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Little is known about the behaviour of this extremely shy and secretive rail, and nowhere in the world has the marsh crake been adequately studied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Marsh Crake is only about 180 mm in size. Feeds on invertebrates, aquatic plant seeds and tiny fish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six to ten cream-coloured eggs with a blue tint are laid between August and December. The female is the sole incubator for 26 days. The peculiar broad bill is predominant as soon as the chick is hatched.&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/157b35b0-2f98-49ce-94e3-f0dbff850e9e.jpg?rnd=0.3253095" align="right" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pairs apparently remain on territory throughout the year, laying 5-7 eggs in Oct – Dec in a shallow dished platform made of short lengths of rushes or sedge. The nest is usually 30-40cm above the water. Both sexes incubate for 16-20 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Few nests have ever been found and little information on breeding habits is available. The nest is described as being made of rushes and acquatic plants loosely woven together and concealed in rushes growing in shallow water. There are two entrances to the nest through the vegetation enclosing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Warning - this can be a high muggle area, though many of them are doing awesome things (especially considering they are muggles).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is in an extremely unusual and original container which took loads of thought and hard work .... a mint tin (bear with us it's our first cache).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.cbbmx.com"&gt;Cambridge BMX&lt;/a&gt; club moved here in the 2011/12 season.&lt;br /&gt;
It's the home of the BMX NZ National championships and mad muggles can be seen most evenings whizzing back and forth over the massive moguls at breakneck speeds. In fact when the muggle quotient is high watching the loonies do their thing is probably much more fun than scrabbling around for mint tins! Club nights are Thursday so it's muggle central. Dates and events are on the CBBMX website. It's a booming little club. At the recent twilight competition 500 riders were registered to ride! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can sit for a moto and watch the holeshot pumping from the start gate go over the doublet, triples and tabletops, manual over a roller and bunny hop to the main! (&lt;a href="http://www.cbbmx.com/bmx-jargon.html"&gt;eh?&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is plenty of parking on the verge, on Lamb Street and Milton Street. The entry is by the Cambridge BMX Club sign&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PLEASE NOTE&lt;br /&gt;
Leave the flowers at GZ alone - they have done nothing to you! &lt;br /&gt;

Please place cache back out of sight carefully&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There have been some AWESOME caches hidden in Hamilton in recent months. Be warned, this hide is not one of them! It's more of a little 'thank-you' to those who've raised the bar with a particular nod to one of our local prolific hiders. Thanks for the caching fun - long may it continue!&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
There's a path down into the gully if you want to explore. A surprisingly good little bridge too. Or just dash'n'grab for another dot-day cache &lt;img src="http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_wink.gif" border="0" align="middle" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Out for a walk with geopup to do some nearby cache maintenance &amp;amp; brought along some spare containers. Unfortunately, there were LOTS of muggle children playing around our preferred hiding spots ... still, it seemed a shame not to hide at least 1 little cache while we were there &lt;img src="http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_wink.gif" border="0" align="middle" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
So, up you get &amp;amp; go stretch your legs along this little walkway.&lt;br /&gt;

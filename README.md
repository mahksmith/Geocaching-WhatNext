An app for Geocaching that reads in a PocketQuery and tells you where the best place for you to go Geocaching based on your preferences and historical data.

Notes for myself for future implementation:
 * Distribution stats -> highest / lowest density areas for both PocketQueries and MyFinds
   - I'd like to make the program produce a .png map of this.
     - Heat map of distribution
  - Heat maps need to be of variable resolution size (bin size)

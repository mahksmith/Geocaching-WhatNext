  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a 35mm film canister hidden on a busy route to Town from Broomfield. Please replace the cache with great care in the place where you find it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broomfield Road is a fairly busy road at certain times as day, such as rush hour, and school collecting time. There tend to be dog walkers, joggers, and people walking to the shops.&lt;br /&gt;But often there is not a soul about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is just about possible on Broomfield Road at quiet times as long as you avoid the double yellow lines and the traffic bollards. Much better to park in one of the nearby residential roads but there are some time restrictions Mon to Fri, so do check the notices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done to Helennbrian FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

The Area also includes the satellite western suburban and central city area of nearby Porirua City and up through the Kapiti Coast. These cities between them house around 350,000 people as well as providing the geographic base for New Zealand's Government and public sector support structure. In addition, the neighbouring Hutt Valley - Wairarapa District adds another 150,000 to the greater Wellington population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Wellington Fire Area comprises 16 stations and 370 personnel. Nine of our stations are manned by full time crews with three of those stations also maintaining a volunteer unit attached to the station. Seven stations are solely volunteer and in addition the Area also has a volunteer operational support unit. The area adjoins the Hutt - Wairarapa area.&lt;/p&gt; Personnel consist of: 199 full time firefighters&lt;br /&gt; # 156 Volunteer firefighters&lt;br /&gt; # 25 Operational Support Personnel&lt;br /&gt; # 1 Area Manager&lt;br /&gt; # 2 Assistant Area Managers&lt;br /&gt; # 2 Administration Support Personnel&lt;br /&gt; # 2 Fire Safety Officers&lt;br /&gt; # 1 Volunteer Support Officer&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hutt - Wairarapa area consists of 11 stations with 3 adjoining volunteer stations. In total, the Wellington region has 30 stations serving a population of 500,000 people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To learn more about the Wellington Fire Service go to the following link&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firestation.org.nz/index.html&quot;&gt;A cool HOT link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#339900&quot; size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;Please bring your own writing instrument&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;Please NOTE that if you must sign the logbook for each individual cachers or proof of a photo for group logs to be emailed to the owner otherwise you log may be deleted.

The time of her reign is known as the Victorian era, a period of industrial, cultural, political, scientific, and military progress within the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Victoria ascended the throne at a time when the United Kingdom was already an established constitutional monarchy, in which the king or queen held relatively few direct political powers and exercised influence by the prime minister's advice; but she still served as a very important symbolic figure of her time. Victoria's reign was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During this period, it reached its zenith and became the foremost global power of the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Victoria was of mostly German descent, the daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and granddaughter of George III and the niece of her predecessor William IV.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She arranged marriages for her 9 children and 42 grandchildren across the continent, tying Europe together and earning her the nickname &quot;the grandmother of Europe&quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/544f716a-db9f-493f-a34a-3ed6eb0c4dd8.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was the last British monarch of the House of Hanover; her son King Edward VII belonged to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href= &quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom&quot;&gt;Link to more info on Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cache a small eclipse container when placed contained a logbook only&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#339900&quot; size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;Please bring your own writing instrument&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;Please NOTE that if you must sign the logbook for each individual cachers or proof of a photo for group logs to be emailed to the owner otherwise you log may be deleted.

Whilst it was supposed to be an easy day, we still managed to find a few caches with terrain ratings over 3 that resulted in a few walks up and down hills that were not intended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had had a couple of attempts at this one before but due to a GPS signal that was bouncing around, had to record a DNF or two!

Along its western edge, the route is located at the foot of the scarp of the Wellington Fault (also referred to as the&quot;western escarpment&quot;). To the east, the Wairarapa and Melling Branch railway lines run the full length of this section of the highway.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In addition thousands of native trees were planted on the shoulders of the project to beautify the downtown Korokoro industrial area.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It was one of the largest and most expensive infrastructure projects in the Wellington region to occur for a while - and was completed before schedule in December 2009. The project also served as a pathfinder for future infrastructure improvements in Wellington in the coming decade.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/0fa91079-f3dd-47a8-a371-c5ace542f6d9.jpg&quot; width=&quot;450px&quot; height=&quot;337.5px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/bfe8b657-3387-4d6d-89f5-eb85c59d2bf1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;450px&quot; height=&quot;337.5px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;Planting North of Percy&apos;s Reserve.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking South from the Korokoro offramp.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Cache Details&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Park at the parking area just southwest of the cache location - and proceed on foot to GZ through the trees, please note it is not on or in the concrete barrier or the safety fence. There is no need to endanger yourself.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The cache itself is a 1L Sistema container which when placed contained a logbook, bouncy balls, glass pebbles, a geocaching notice and the &apos;Capital Capital Sweden GC&apos; when placed. There is no pen / pencil so please BYO. There is a small prize for the FTF. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Using the big cog (displayed in Cog Park), a massive chain, a steam engine and 320 metres of track, ships were pulled out of the water here to have maintenance done or damage fixed. It took three years for men in diving bells to lay 213 metres of the track under water. It was quite an engineering feat for the late 1800&apos;s, with the first boat taking thirteen minutes to rise up the slip. At one stage the big chain broke and a 1,700 tonne ship thundered down the slip and kept going until it hit Miramar. To put this into perspective, the Arahura Interislander is 2,257 tonnes. Can you imagine a ship almost as big as the Arahura hauled up on this track? Taken from The Pioneer&apos;s of Port Nicholson by David McGill, available at Wellington City Council Libraries. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/8ace4af5-cee4-4649-9f67-a9d3bb4525a5.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;font face=&quot;arial black&quot; color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;Cache is a black camoed eclipse mint container on one of the small cart's axles.&lt;br /&gt; It will be necessary to bring your own writing implement to sign the log.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A degree of stealth may be required as the park is overlooked by the adjacent apartments.&lt;br /&gt; It is best to feign a real interest in the little &quot;carts&quot;.&lt;br /&gt; Please replace the container as found.&lt;/font&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Balaena Bay used to be the leading area for boat building in Wellington in the early 1900&#x2019;s, with the messy yards not wanted cluttering up the waterfront elsewhere. It was cheaper to have a boat built in Auckland than shipping the Kauri to Wellington, but local boat builders were kept busy as their skills were needed to adapt Auckland pleasure craft to the rougher local conditions. Many of the Island Bay fishing fleet were built here in the 1920&#x2019;s. &lt;br /&gt;Today it is a popular beach for sun bathers and swimmers during the summer; it is quite sheltered from the northerly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also my favorite kayak launching spot for a paddle around Point Halswell to Seatoun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is a 125ml round container with a log sheet and pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please ensure that you replace it exactly where and how you found it so that it doesn&#x2019;t go missing. No spoilers or photographs of the cache location in your logs please.</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">How many times have you driven past here and thought - i wonder why these are there? Well nearby to the cache is a plaque stating -&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This City is indebted to the generosity of the estate of the late &lt;br /&gt;GEORGE H CARTER &lt;br /&gt;by whose bequest these roadside gardens were made possible -1955-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, beautiful spots all over Wellington (and undoubtedly the country) are only there due to inidividuals generosity. This cache is hopefully bringing more people here - and a big thumbs up to George.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is a clear 200ml square Sistema container (with camo tape on) with blue clips, not much bigger than an adult clenched fist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial Contents: &lt;br /&gt;* Blue mini stickman &lt;br /&gt;* Pencil sharpener &lt;br /&gt;* Mini koosh ball &lt;br /&gt;* 2 marbles &lt;br /&gt;* UK 5p coin &lt;br /&gt;* Bulldog clip &lt;br /&gt;* Wellington canes bead &lt;br /&gt;* Wrist lanyard &lt;br /&gt;* Pen log book &amp; geocaching sheet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure to replace and hide as found as i suspect this may be a popular spot at night! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE - a few finders have reported coming across various items of nighttime frivolity - please be aware that you may come across these types of items but hopefully you may be able to still enjoy the location.</groundspeak:long_description>

It was a quick find then!! Nice views here :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consec caching day #371&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TFTC!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;For info on the next NZ mega, and to pre- register, go to:&lt;br /&gt;www.nzmega2015.com</groundspeak:text>

Easily accessible log-only micro-cache. Restored 2/10/2010 following refurbishment of the site.</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Parade Cafe is a floating cafe/restaurant, situated in a lagoon looking over the Wellington city lights and harbour.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for looking at and photographing and they do great coffees, cakes, lunches and dinners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parade Cafe previously operated in an old building across the road, but moved into the tugboat in September 2010 following demolition of their building, taking over from the less favoured Tugboat on the Bay restaurant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Situated in Oriental Bay, Wellington&#x2019;s most expensive real estate, and is only a 15 minute stroll down the wharf from the most expensive shopping (Lambton Quay). There are several caches along the waterfront &#x2013; why not find them on your way. In particular, take the kids on a light stroll to discover Bronzed in Oriental Bay (GC1KH22), an easy multi-cache all within 750 m along the parade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your swimming gear for a swim at the adjacent Freyberg pool or Oriental Bay beach, and stop to let the kids play on the playground equipment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tugboat was formerly the Auckland Harbour Board tug AUCKLANDER. Renamed TAPUHI II, the 29-year-old AUCKLANDER began its new career as Wellington's &quot;Tugboat on the Bay&quot; in early 1987.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oriental Bay beach is a man-made beach originally created from the ballast of sailing ships and is now maintained by the city council who recently brought in barges of golden sand from Golden Bay (top of the South Island) to enhance its appearance. (For the annual beach volleyball tournament last year they even brought in truckloads of fine grey sand so the players would have a nice soft surface. After the competition the grey sand was taken away again!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A log-only micro-cache. Contains logbook only - bring your own pencil. Muggles abound in this area, so you will need to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTF honours go to bjtrekker.</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;[Stroller accessible, available 24-7, stealth required, parking available, public transit available, scenic view, takes less than 1 hour, kid friendly]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wellington City Council has redeveloped Cobblestone Park to make it more attractive and increase its usage.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Located on Vivian Street and bounded by Dunlop Terrace and Knigges Avenue, Cobblestone Park is next to the Victoria University Faculty of Architecture and Design.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/4f78615f-0989-47f3-a366-de88c7b8c480.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cobblestone Park forms an important urban knuckle that hinges Victoria University&apos;s Design School into the Cuba Quarter . In addition the park is a valuable component of Wellington City&apos;s open space network. The park is a vital green space for the densely populated Upper Cuba Street sector, however, its current configuration and aging infrastructure compromise park usability, safety and allure. In response, this proposal defines a new model for the site, an Urban Archipelago, a series of urban &apos;islands&apos; each offering a distinct experience catering to a range of community needs. The ensemble of urban islands (park terraces) is bound together within a framework of re-defined pedestrian circulation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/7d2c908f-4fbd-47d5-8a9d-1cfb87b3dd09.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The park was officially re-opened by Mayor Kerry Prendergast on 4 August 2010.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The redeveloped park has new walls, paths, lawns, trees, planter beds, lights, seats and, playground equipment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The previous park was designed and built in 1974 in a modernist English character style. Designer Mary Buckland wanted to create a place that was &quot;soft and natural&quot; and &quot;a small restful island in a busy part of the city&quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However the area around the park had seen a large rise in the number of residents over the last 10 years, increasing pressure on the existing open spaces. While the park was appropriate for the 1970s, the increasing population and need for better quality green space in the city meant we needed to redevelop the park.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cache is an esclipse container containing a logbook only.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#339900&quot; size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;When placed the cache contained a logbook only.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#339900&quot; size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;Please bring you own writing instrument&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;Please replace it back to the exact position that you found it as we don't want it to be muggled as this location is a VERY high muggle location. Also NO SPOILERS of the final location as we don't want to spoil it for other cachers.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;Please NOTE that if you must sign the logbook for each individual cachers or proof of a photo for group logs to be emailed to the owner otherwise you log may be deleted.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">We love public artwork that we would otherwise have missed. A Wellington walk with grandparents, who we introduced to caching, and now they love it. Wind, sunshine, a dry cache, wonderful. Luckily we brought tweezers to extract log! Cheers from Team Bearsley</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">#927 - The bigger challange as to find this cache was to find the i-site! Our navi in the car send us to an other place. On our map, the i-site was signed on an other place - by chance we saw the i-site. After we collected all information we needed, we're looked for the cache. The clou makes it easy... and so a quick grab and the cache is ours. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

Visible from the hills and the city, the huge rusting frame stood as testimony to the now faded power of the trade unions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Now this cache sits at the foot of one of Wellington's best known &#8216;modern' buildings. Standing darkly different from those around it, the BNZ tower (I simply can not get my head around calling it State Insurance), was completed in 1984. It was however designed in the late 60s, and ended up being one of the longest construction projects in New Zealand, not due to its complexity or size, but because of the industrial unrest during its construction. This particularly involved the boilermakers union- who claimed the exclusive entitlement for their members to weld together the massive steel frames of the building- striking and working to rule for long periods. Tales tell of the same weld performed 20 days on the trot because it had to be continuous and was always just unfinished at knock-off time each day, so had to be started fresh again the next day. These actions had huge effects not only leading to the glacial progress on the building, but to the complete avoidance of steel framed buildings in New Zealand for twenty years, the eventual deregistration of the Boilermakers Union by the government, and ultimately the demise to a large extent of the labour movement itself.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/ba98746e-63bd-4b6e-b3b3-d0b15901dc18.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; FACTS- The building is 102-metres high and was the tallest in New Zealand for the next three years, and the tallest in Wellington for seven years until it was overtaken in 1991 by the Majestic Centre. It is clad in black Brazilian granite, and in this writer's humble architectural opinion, was always about half the height it should have been to look proportionally right!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As for all our Wellington City caches, the GPS signal can not be completely relied on, but hopefully the hiding place will become illuminated to you once you are near. Many many muggles (including some police ones) will be looking down on you from all directions, so be light on your feet, otherwise this might just turn into another pipe dream. There is no need to damage any vegetation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;hr color=&quot;#0000FF&quot; /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Tawa railway station was opened on the 21st of September 1885,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally known as 'Tawa Flat', the station was built by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company and was located about 600 meters south, about where the Redwood station is located today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The railway line originally ran through Johnsonville to the south of Tawa, but due to the impracticalities of this (due to steep gradients) the railway line was diverted through Tawa in the form it takes today.The deviation was opened to goods trains in 1935 and to passenger trains in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In June of 1940 the line was electrified through Tawa and in 1957 the line was doubled tracked as far a Porirua.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is a 200ml Sistema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure that the cache is hidden as you found it as this is a high muggle area!</groundspeak:long_description>

The prominence of this small peak is hard to spot due to the heavy cover of pine trees that now exist, but is readily apparent in earlier photos, as below.&#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Although the Town Belt was largely covered in native forest in 1840, this had been cleared by the late 1860s with livestock farming dominating Wellington's hills for the rest of the 19th century, and well into the 20th century. In the 1930s the first major reforestation project began when government relief workers planted the flanks of Mt Victoria and Tinakori Hill with exotic trees &#8211; pine and macrocarpa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/d754ff19-6bd1-4cf4-a82e-52cfe3584695.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mt Alfred&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;height:333px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height:normal;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;small&gt;View of Wellington College and Mount Alfred, from the Mount Cook&#160;Barracks, 1930&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;The location of the cache on this small hilltop is on the site, or close to where Te Akatarewa Pa, an old stockaded village inhabited by Ngai-Tara, once stood. The pa was built here because it is one of the higher points on this ridgeline, which was known in pre-European times as Te Ranga a Hiwi &#8211; the hill ridge of Hiwi. Hiwi, who lived in the Akatarewa Pa, was the son of Hine-Kiti, a famous chieftainess of Ngati-Hinewai, hapu of Ngai-Tara.&lt;/p&gt; The ridgeline comprised a series of significant sites and was seen as a defensive line through the area particularly to Ngai-Tara. A series of pa or forts extended from Point Jernimgham near the site of Waihirere Pa through Te Akatarewa Pa and out to Uruhau Pa (Island Bay) and Haewai (Houghton Bay). &lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left;height:171px;width:636px;&quot;&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;height:122px;text-align:center;width:324px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The peak was later named Mount Alfred after Prince Alfred, the second son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Prince Alfred was created Duke of Edinburgh in 1866, and became the first member of the Royal Family to visit New Zealand, arriving in Wellington in 1869 as captain of the frigate HMS Galatea.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;height:122px;width:294px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/34b6226f-1af1-4b8b-bd43-5899dd57ba7f.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;height:214px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr style=&quot;width:100%;height:2px;&quot; /&gt; &lt;p&gt;You are encouraged to include pictures with your log (just no spoilers).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;padding:10pt;text-align:center;background-color:rgb(255, 204, 102);font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;CANZ Series Maintained by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=8ManAfter&quot;&gt;8ManAfter&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=rediguana&quot;&gt;rediguana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This day saw us collect the remainder of the Kiwi GeoTrail, as well as many other caches in the area. Another big day of geocaching for us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KFNZ have already previously found this cache, so they stayed in the warmth of the car while we quickly headed out to make this grab.

Red Square is often considered the central square of Moscow and indeed all of Russia, since major streets of Moscow radiate from here in all directions, becoming major highways outside the city.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;The name Red Square derives neither from the colour of the bricks around it (which, in fact, were whitewashed at certain points in history) nor from the link between the colour red and communism. Rather, the name came about because the Russian word Krasnaya can mean either &quot;red&quot; or &quot;beautiful&quot; (the latter being archaic). This word, with the meaning &quot;beautiful&quot;, was originally applied to Saint Basil's Cathedral and was subsequently transferred to the nearby square. It is believed that the square acquired its current name in the 17th Century, replacing the older Pozhar, or &quot;burnt-out place&quot;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;The cache is a micro containing only a waterproof log sheet. You will need to bring your own writing implement. Please replace the cache as found. A degree of stealth may be required at some times of day.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:0px;border-top:1px solid silver;padding-top:5px;&quot;&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gps.org.nz/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gps.org.nz/images/gps_small.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;gps.org.nz home page&quot; height=&quot;57&quot; width=&quot;125&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td valign=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;For more information about geocaching in New Zealand,&lt;br /&gt; visit the New Zealand Recreational GPS Society &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://forums.gps.org.nz/&quot;&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gps.org.nz/&quot;&gt;website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A specially hybridised camellia bush called &quot;Volunteer&quot; was planted here to mark the year. Volunteers also planted other trees and plants including azaleas, hebes, lancewoods and native grasses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/e5b29729-f2a4-4a50-9f79-42bc9d847b10.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;June 2002 saw the unveiling of a plaque commemorating volunteers. Another ceremony was held in December 2003 in memory of William Holden, a committed volunteer and member of the IYV group.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cache holds only a logsheet. Please bring your own pen. The cache is easily accessible, without disturbing the living plants in the garden. However, a high degree of stealth is required when finding and replacing the cache.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Update (31 May 2009): The cache has been moved south-east to a hopefully more secure location.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

When returning, please ensure that the cache is placed deep inside together with the small object that sits on top of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;GCEE0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; While you're here, you may also want to log Donovan's virtual cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GCEE0&amp;Submit6=Go&quot;&gt; GCEE0 Mount Victoria&lt;/a&gt; located at the top of the lookout. This cache has been here a long time (much longer than we've been geocaching) and we contacted Donovan to make sure that he does not mind having a physical cache nearby to complement his virtual cache.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congratulations for first to find!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://i384.photobucket.com/albums/oo286/geocaching_nz/Icon_Gold_small.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=2b6e332d-5b41-4a7b-8c6c-8d0c11b65361&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/stats/img.aspx?txt=First+to+Find&amp;uid=2b6e332d-5b41-4a7b-8c6c-8d0c11b65361&amp;bg=1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; title=&quot;Profile for Yeetrees&quot; alt=&quot;Profile for Yeetrees&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Yeetrees&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://i384.photobucket.com/albums/oo286/geocaching_nz/Icon_Silver_small.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=9dd1a7fe-8a79-4640-92f8-02de398166e2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/stats/img.aspx?txt=Second+to+Find&amp;uid=9dd1a7fe-8a79-4640-92f8-02de398166e2&amp;bg=1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; title=&quot;Profile for taybee&quot; alt=&quot;Profile for taybee&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;taybee&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://i384.photobucket.com/albums/oo286/geocaching_nz/Icon_Bronze_small.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=6c6fd4e5-1f2f-4679-aee7-5fd726cb5ba4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/stats/img.aspx?txt=Third+to+Find&amp;uid=6c6fd4e5-1f2f-4679-aee7-5fd726cb5ba4&amp;bg=1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; title=&quot;Profile for GeoGeoKiwi&quot; alt=&quot;Profile for GeoGeoKiwi&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;GeoGeoKiwi&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;FTF medals designed &amp; created by bjtrekker&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Creating the park has turned the area that used to be known as &#8220;Chaffers&#8221; into &#8220;Wellington's newest, biggest and most exciting urban park.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The development has been designed in three areas, allowing separate implementation of the park area first (Area One).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wellingtonwaterfront.co.nz/docs/A_100_masterplan.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/85fdba31-290e-45c3-8cc1-f60a44628741.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wellingtonwaterfront.co.nz/docs/A_100_masterplan.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that Area One is complete, you can bring the family down for a picnic then send the teenagers off to the skate park, while the younger ones can play safely in the Children's Play Garden. Meanwhile, the adults can enjoy a game of petanque or watch the kids at play while enjoying a fresh coffee. Alternatively, you can head down to the Park in the evening with your fish 'n chips, watch a concert on the Park's central open field, enjoy the sunset, paddle in the tide at the new beach or stroll along the new boardwalk promenade. If you have a few paint spray cans left over from your cache camo exploits, you can bring them down and decorate the &quot;aerosol art walls.&quot; Something for everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cache is in an area identified on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wellingtonwaterfront.co.nz/docs/A_100_masterplan.pdf&quot;&gt;Master Plan&lt;/a&gt; as &#8220;Shadows of Waka passage ways.&#8221; I'll leave you to figure out what that is all about. The cache is a 200ml Sistema containing a few small swaps and with room for small trackables. Please replace carefully to ensure it does not get muggled in this busy spot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;Published with special permission from geocaching.com&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:0px;border-top:1px solid silver;padding-top:5px;&quot;&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gps.org.nz/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gps.org.nz/images/gps_small.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;gps.org.nz home page&quot; height=&quot;57&quot; width=&quot;125&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td valign=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;For more information about geocaching in New Zealand,&lt;br /&gt; visit the New Zealand Recreational GPS Society &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://forums.gps.org.nz/&quot;&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gps.org.nz/&quot;&gt;website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">With one inner city cache already found this lunch hour it was time to wander off and find this one, which has been a tempting target for many weeks now. There didn't seem to be much choice of hiding place and a bit of careful groping around soon turned up trumps. Log signed and cache returned in short order. Nice to have a look at the 'bars' from above rather than from below like I normally do every day I drive home from work. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Despite the outbreak of war, the exhibition was a lavish affair. Held on 55 acres of land at Rongotai it featured three exhibition courts, grand Art Deco-style edifices and a hugely popular three-acre amusement park dubbed Playland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the exhibition closed in May 1940 more than 2.5 million people had passed through the gates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1956 this fountain from the exhibition was relocated here, and refurbished to mark the centenary of electricity supply in Wellington. It was re-commissioned by the Mayor - Sir James Belich in December 1988.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have from memory never seen this fountain in action, if you are lucky enough to see it going when you are here, take a photo and post it with your log.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please NOTE that you must sign the logbook for each individual cacher, Finds logged online not corrosponding with the logbook may be deleted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no need to climb onto or into the fountain to retrieve the cache.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">I found this tricky to get to. My GPS doesn't have a map, so I followed the arrow and walked uphill. It pointed me to a dirt track through a forest, so I followed that. Then I think I took the wrong track, but easy remedied I figured; GZ was only thirty metres away. So I left the track and uphill through the forest I went, ending up on hands and knees pulling myself up the last bit of the steep slope. After several near slides back down the slope I made it and crawled out of the trees. I hung onto the wire fence and made my way along it. After that getting to GZ and finding the cache was easy.

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is the only place in Wellington where you get to see both working cable cars at the same time. I recommend taking the cable car to the Talavera station where the cache is hidden. The overbridge means there is no need to cross any tracks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The half way cable car station, Talavera, is a lovely place to watch the cable cars pass each other. Even though you are near town, the surrounding bush leaves you feeling in a different world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is a 200ml sistema retrievable without climbing any fences. The reception can be dodgy - but the hint will get you to the right place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please surpervise children closely near the road &amp; the cable car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache contains:&lt;br /&gt;Geocaching information&lt;br /&gt;Log &amp; pen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations!&lt;br /&gt;FTF - Dean(o) - I'm impressed you used the cable car&lt;br /&gt;2TF - TGC4&lt;br /&gt;3TF - huhugrub&lt;br /&gt;4TF - kjwx</groundspeak:long_description>

Please bring your own writing implement as the cache contains the log only. GPS reception is very patchy around the gz but use of the hint should ensure the find. For this reason the final coordinates were calculated by projecting a waypoint from higher up where I had an accuracy of +-3m&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As this pathway gets quite a lot of use, please use an appropriate amount of stealth while accessing the cache as muggles can appear with little or no warning and please take care when re-hiding the cache to help prevent it from being muggled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It appears that there is someone living under the Aurora Tce bridge so keep this in mind while in the area.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">Back in Wellington again, and that means back to check this cache. Again. Twice I have been here and not found it. This time I before I got here, I checked the logs (it is a right pain to to be hunting for a cache that the logs have identified as missing). Okay, it is still here, and apparently not at GZ, but on the lower path! No wonder I could not find it. At GZ my GPS said the cache was 2m uphill, as per both times before. So I ignored it and walked around to the lower path. Now my GPS thinks I am on the other side of the motorway, 75m away. Okay, it's not going to be any help! But the cache was soon found by checking all the hint objects along the path. Nice hide, you get a favourite, and the cache gets a path tag.&lt;br /&gt;No homeless guy this time.</groundspeak:text>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I'm starting off with a nice easy cache, as it's just my first. Nothing too challenging, just a good spot to have your lunch at during your break from work. The name of the cache should make sense when you get there.

The park was created to promote Hungarian-New Zealand relations and understanding and to provide a permanent focal point perpetuating the presence of Hungarians living in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is an expression of Hungarians' appreciation to their adoptive country and offers future generations of New Zealand Hungarians a legacy of their Hungarian heritage. In a setting with trees and shrubs typically found in Hungary, the park has two characteristically Hungarian features: a decorative wooden gate (sz&#233;kely kapu) that was carved in Transylvania and gifted by the Hungarian Government, and a locally carved wooden plinth (kopjafa) symbolising freedom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A testimony to New Zealand's cultural diversity, the Magyar Millennium Park will add to Wellington's tourist attractions and be a landmark for New Zealand-Hungarians and Hungarian visitors to the city, especially on Hungary's 3 national days, 15 March, 20 August and 23 October.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The cache that is hidden here is a small screw top canister with a logbook and pencil, no room for trades, Please return it to exactly where you found it.

The container is placed in a quiet spot away from the main entrance</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Old St Paul's is a fine example of 19th century Gothic Revival architecture adapted to colonial conditions and materials. Designed by the Reverend Frederick Thatcher, then vicar of St Paul's parish Thorndon, the first Anglican cathedral of Wellington is considered his best work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Constructed entirely from native timbers, the glowing interior is enhanced by stunning stained glass windows. Memorial items and displays tell the early history of Wellington.&lt;br /&gt;No longer a parish church but still consecrated, Old St Paul's remains a place of spiritual significance to many and is living testimony to one of New Zealand's greatest heritage battles. It is a well-loved venue for weddings and other services, concerts, recitals and many other cultural events. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old St Paul's is one of New Zealand's most important historic places, and is a magnificent example of timber Gothic Revival architecture. The building was erected in 1866, the second Anglican church in Thorndon. It was built on land bought by Bishop Selwyn in Mulgrave Street in 1845, augmented with a Crown grant of Maori reserve from Governor Grey in 1853.&lt;br /&gt;Plans for the church were drawn up in 1862 by Reverend Frederick Thatcher (1814-1890), then vicar of St Paul's parish. Thatcher was an English-born architect, who later trained as an Anglican Minister at the College of St John's, Auckland. Both Thatcher and Selwyn were heavily influenced by the teachings of the English Ecclesiological Society (a movement that advocated a return to a Gothic style of religious architecture) and the design of the new church reflects this. The foundation stone was not laid until August 1865. It was built by John McLaggan for &#xA3;3,472. The church was finally consecrated the following year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is NOT hidden on or under the church building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cache contains a log sheet and pencil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please NOTE that you must sign the logsheet for each individual cacher, Finds logged not corrosponding with the logbook may be deleted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please take some time before leaving to ensure that the cache is re-hidden exactly as you found it. And please dont drop it when retrieving and replacing</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/3a1fa24d-b844-4159-a337-fad58d8fbb13.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Thistle Inn, built in 1840, is the oldest hotel in New Zealand still trading from its original site. Originally the Thistle was only metres from the shoreline, and patrons often arrived by boat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story goes that renowned Ngati Toa chief Te Rauparaha would pull up his waka right outside the pub, wander in and order a whiskey and no one had the gumption to charge him. Te Rauparaha is perhaps most famous for composing &quot;Ka Mate&quot;, the haka made famous by the All Blacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/efc46b39-bea6-4d8c-9ddd-4fd6d516c8fb.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache&lt;/b&gt; is a camoed eclipse tin containing only a log book, so you will have to bring your own pen. You will need to be stealthy, as the area is frequented by public servant muggles.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lambton Quay&lt;/strong&gt; (once known as &quot;Beach Street&quot;) is the heart of the central business district of Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;Originally, as the name implies, it was the high-water line of the foreshore, and sometimes the sea would roll across the road and enter the shops on the opposite side. It was the site of the original settlement in 1840, which grew into Wellington. Land uplift caused by an earthquake in 1855 and further reclamation have left the street some 250 metres from the current shoreline.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;Lambton Quay is named after John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham, the first chairman of directors of the New Zealand Company.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;Lambton Quay and neighbouring Willis Street form what is known locally as the Golden Mile. Much of the city's retail trade is now centred a little further south around Manners Street and Cuba Street, but Lambton Quay remains a major commercial thoroughfare. It is also of administrative significance, with the New Zealand Parliament Buildings towards the northern end. The Wellington cenotaph is also located at this end, next to Parliament.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;The Wellington Cable Car runs from Lambton Quay to the top of the Botanic Garden.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face= &quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;Midland Park&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;Midland Park is named for the Midland Hotel, built in 1917. The city's first Spanish Mission-style building, it's exotic design was the work of architect Henry Eli White, who had designed the St James Theatre in Courtenay Place (1912). In 1979 the building was acquired from its owner Lion Breweries by the Wellington City Council, which replaced it with a park in 1982. The hotel is still remembered fondly by many Wellingtonians.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face= &quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;Reclamation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;This part of Lambton Quay offers a good vantage point to appreciate what was once the harbour edge. The road closely follows the alignment of the former beach. The first reclamation began off Willis Street in 1852. Reclamation continued into the 20th century and did not cease until the mid-1970's, by which time 360 hectares had been reclaimed from the harbour. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;Source:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambton_Quay&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;The cache is a black Eclipse container. Please place back exactly how you discovered it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;When placed it contained the following:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;Log book&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Please bring your own pen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

He was a founding member of Wellington Chamber of Commerce, and helped create a company to construct the railway between Wellington and Manawatu &#8211; for which the seaside town of Plimmerton was named after him.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/0441cdaf-eda1-4ec4-8d42-d46d15b44bcc.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;380&quot; width=&quot;210&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; His permanent family home was on the hill above &#8220;Clay Point&#8221;, now the corner of Lambton Quay and Willis Street. The alternative to going around that point was climbing the hill and walking down Boulcott St, a route that has become Plimmer Steps. The oak tree Plimmer planted still grows there near the vivid, tiled fountain that records his arrival on the &#8216;Gertrude'.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Other landmarks in his honour include a bronze statue of him with&lt;br /&gt; his dog Fritz on Lambton Quay, Plimmer House on Boulcott Street&lt;br /&gt; and the bell from the &#8216;Inconstant' which hangs in St Alban's&lt;br /&gt; Church at Pauatahanui.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Plimmer, who died on January 5, 1905 aged 92, is buried in Bolton Street Cemetery.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;To find this cache, you must sail to the watery resting place of the &#8216;Gertrude' on Plimmer Steps.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://mp.natlib.govt.nz/image/?imageId=images-37130&amp;profile=access&quot; align=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Published with permission from geocaching.com&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt; Difficulty rating amended to reflect user comments.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">Last day of our wonderful OAT tour of NZ. Passed by here 3 or 4 times in past two days going and coming with our group, including one quick hunt after dark &#x2013; unsuccessful. Came back this morning intent on the find and succeeded. Good hide! And we enjoyed learning about Plimmer and his dog, plus seeing this artsy fountain. And, the steps were a good workout. Did a fair amount of CITO in the planter. SLTNLN.

It is the oldest sporting club in Wellington and the 3rd oldest sporting organisation in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The club was first located near the Cenotaph, by Parliament Buildings. Reclamation work on the waterfront in 1874 necessitated the club's first move, to Lambton Quay. As further waterfront reclamation work started, another move was required in 1883. This resulted in the present clubhouse being completed in 1887.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/c77bc25f-aa1f-429e-a457-3cc189135cf2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;The Boatshed on Customhouse Quay (pre-1889)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;p&gt;William Chatfield, the Thorndon Village Architect, designed the current club building (commonly known as The Boatshed) in 1885. Since the club had already had previous moves due to reclamation, Chatfield showed considerable foresight and designed the building on iron rails. In 1889 it was towed away from impending reclamation by a steam engine to 51 Jervois Quay, where it remained for 100 years. In 1989, Lambton Harbour Management moved The Boatshed from alongside the Wellington Free Ambulance Building to its current position by Frank Kitts Lagoon. The Boatshed is now listed as a category A historic building.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The Cache&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There have been two other caches in this area (&lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GCMN94&quot;&gt;Dragoon Haze GCMN94&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC1CAMK&quot;&gt;Dragoon Haze II GC1CAMK&lt;/a&gt;), but both had muggle troubles and were eventually archived. This cache is in a slightly different spot and should have more cover.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please take care not to destroy the vegetation when searching as this will remove the cache's cover.&lt;/strong&gt; There is no need to leave the path. The cache is a camo 1.2L Sistema, and when placed contained the following items in addition to the log book and pen:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;gonefishing fish&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;coral&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;toy car&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Snoopy toy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;carabina&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;lanyard&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;marbles&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:0px;border-top:1px solid silver;padding-top:5px;&quot;&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gps.org.nz/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gps.org.nz/images/gps_small.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;gps.org.nz home page&quot; height=&quot;57&quot; width=&quot;125&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td valign=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;For more information about geocaching in New Zealand,&lt;br /&gt; visit the New Zealand Recreational GPS Society &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://forums.gps.org.nz/&quot;&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gps.org.nz/&quot;&gt;website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Whilst it was supposed to be an easy day, we still managed to find a few caches with terrain ratings over 3 that resulted in a few walks up and down hills that were not intended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approached this one from a different angle but once we re-read the hint, the cache was soon secured!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2227</groundspeak:text>

This cache brings you to The National War Memorial located on Buckle Street in Wellington was dedicated in 1932 on Anzac Day in commemoration of the First World War.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/20619139-c4e4-4745-87d6-0261c28b0f46.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The memorial also officially remembers the New Zealanders who gave their lives in the South African War, World War II and the wars in Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam. The War Memorial consists of the War Memorial Carillon, the Hall of Memories, and an unknown New Zealand warrior interred in a tomb constructed in 2004 in front of the Hall of Memories. Four Rolls of Honour bear the names and ranks of 28,654 New Zealanders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The Carillon&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/d2bf379b-f5e1-4867-a982-db9bbb5f29cc.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Carillon was designed as a sister instrument to the Peace Tower in Ottawa, Canada. The bells were made in Croydon England and arrived in New Zealand in January 1931. The original 49 bells were private donations in memory of World War I casualties. Each of these bells has a name and dedication inscription.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since 1984 the Carillon has been substantially rebuilt and enlarged. Twenty mid-range bells have been replaced, and twenty one smaller treble bells have been added. In 1995 the government donated four very large bass bells, Peace (Rangimarie), Hope (Tumanako), Grace (Aroha) and Remembrance (Whakamaharatanga) to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the end of World War II. Peace is the largest bell in the southern hemisphere..&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The complex made considerable use of New Zealand stone. The carillon was clad with pinkish-brown Putaruru stone. Unfortunately the material was variable and weathered badly in places. It was removed from the carillon and replaced by Takaka marble in 1982. The Carillon ranks as the third largest in the world by total weight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The National War Memorial Carillon now has 74 bells ranging in size from 10kgs to 12.5 tonnes. With a combined weight of 70.5 tonnes, the Carillon is the third largest of its kind in the world. It has a musical range of 6.5 octaves. The Largest Bell in the Carillon is 'PEACE' -- Rangimarie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More info can be found at the following Web page &lt;a rel= &quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nationalwarmemorial.govt.nz/&quot;&gt;Link to National War Memorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Hall of Memories&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/ca6a7c18-2523-4c47-b396-df6fd8995d16.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/708cdb10-6641-4c90-ba55-2f41d0aa2345.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hall of Memories is approached through an octagonal vestibule forming the base of the Carillon Tower. Inside there are six memorial alcoves on each side leading up to an apse and Sanctuary at the southern end of the Hall. These alcoves are designed as small side chapels dedicated to the different branches of the New Zealand Armed Forces that have served in overseas conflicts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The National Memorial is open at the following times to the general public&lt;/p&gt; Monday-Saturday 10:30am to 4:30pm&lt;br /&gt; Sunday Noon to 4.30pm&lt;br /&gt; Closed Good Friday and Christmas Day only&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Tomb of the Unknown Warrior&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;To serve as a focus of remembrance for the sacrifice made by all New Zealand servicemen and women, in 2004 a project was undertaken to repatriate the body of an unknown warrior for burial in the new Tomb of the Unknown Warrior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Unknown Warrior is one of over 250,000 New Zealanders who served in overseas wars. He is one of 30,000 who died in service. He is one of over 9000 who have no known grave or whose remains could never be recovered. The remains were chosen by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission from the Caterpillar Valley Cemetery, near where the New Zealand Division fought in 1916.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the soldier's name, rank, regiment, race, religion and other details are unknown, he represents and honours all New Zealanders who became lost to their families in war.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Warrior was finally laid to rest in the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior on Thursday 11 November 2004, Armistice Day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Tomb is sealed with a bronze mantel bearing the words:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;An Unknown New Zealand Warrior&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He Toa Matangaro No Aotearoa&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The Cache&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cache is a 200ml sistema containing a logbook and writing instrument only when placed and has room for swaps. The difficulty rating is the ability of retrieving the cache as it is placed in a very HIGH muggle location.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;Please replace it back to the exact position that you found it as we don't want it to be muggled as this location is a VERY high muggle location.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;Please NOTE that if you must sign the logbook for each individual cachers or proof of a photo for group logs to be emailed to the owner otherwise you log may be deleted.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Unlike most public buildings, which were built by the Public Works Department, the Prison Department undertook the construction of the new police station. Prison labour was supplied from the nearby Mount Cook and Terrace Gaols. In addition, the Mount Cook Gaol (located on the hill above the station where the old Dominion Museum is today) supplied the bricks to build the building and the boundary wall. If you look closely you will be able to see the arrow marks on the prison bricks. These are particularly visible on the boundary wall that runs along Tasman Street.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache&lt;/b&gt; is located at S41 18.ABC, E174 46.DEF&lt;br /&gt; A=Number of letters in the word printed on the blue light above the doorway minus 6&lt;br /&gt; B=Number of flowers on Tasman St-Buckle St corner of building below lower row of multicoloured bricks, divided by 5&lt;br /&gt; C=Number of triangles on gates next to barracks divided by 2&lt;br /&gt; D=Second digit in number on front door x2&lt;br /&gt; E=Number of letters in first word on faded blue plaque&lt;br /&gt; next to doorway minus number of letters in third word on plaque&lt;br /&gt; F=Number of arched windows on Tasman Street side minus 6&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Checksum=19&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Co-ordinates are accurate to +/-10 metres.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">Find #1694. In town early with the bike to collect the last few I couldn't locate on my last visit. Nice and quiet at this time of morning so easy to get around undisturbed. Answered the questions as quickly as I could but was over hasty and ended up in the wrong place so returned to discover my mistake. A quick ride up the hill and with it being so quiet the cache was a quick find. SL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

This is also a great place for watching airplanes arrive and depart the Wellington runway with some awesome ability displayed by pilots on very windy days. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache isnt hard to locate but care needs to be taken when re-placing to ensure it is snug and out of view.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">With a boyfriend nursing a monster handover and a few hours to kill before our flight to Auckland I decided a drive down by the seaside for some fresh air was just what was required. We had a nice lunch, well I did anyway, at a little cafe down the coast and we decided to pick this cache up on the way back towards the airport. We parked nearby and headed in to find the cache. There were two women sitting behind a rock as we walked down towards the cache, but thankfully there was another rock between them and the cache. The same could not be said for the large seagull. This seagull looks like it might be in the process of trying to set up a nest right on top of the cache. It flew off as we approached but continued to fly around the area, complaining most heartily about our presents in the area. &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I got the log signed and we walked off leaving the seagull in peace. &lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the cache Felix! This is likely to be my most southerly cache for some time!!</groundspeak:text>

For these reasons please treat this location with extra special care so as not to affect the delicate ecological/sociological balance of the site. The site boasts a collection of mighty edifices recognising a) the importance of sacrifice for the greater good, b) the original people of this land, c) the future development of the children, and d) the health and wellbeing of the community. Quite a place....&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The location is on a walkway that links between the Karori Pool carpark on Donald street and Campbell Street (next to the kindergarten). At the coordinates look for one of the items mentioned in the title- this is the outer cache- but then the problem is how to get to the actual inner cache (a pill bottle) to sign the log. You will need some toolage assistance to retrieve the inner cache. We've provided this right there, but hidden a bit so you'll need to do a preliminary hunt- don't drop them!. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As always - there are two hints- the first quite cryptic, the second very specific. Use only what you need.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The difficulty rating as well as reflecting the camo nature and method of inner cache retrieval also recognises that it will take you a few minutes to achieve the extraction and those inquisitive Sub-Urban muggles can turn up at anytime from two different directions, and may interupt and even setback retrieval of the Inner Cache. As said on earlier pipe dream caches though, sometimes you have to work hard to achieve your Sub-Urban dreams- so don't get frustrated as you climb that ladder to success!.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Please replace everything just as you found it for the next cacher. Also NO SPOILERS of the final location please.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you enjoyed this study of Sub-Urban life, please feel free to explore this topic further by trying the other Sub-Urban series caches- Light and Bright Sub-Urban Streets (GC2MM47) is located 350 metres to the North, Sub-Urban Pipe Dream #2 is 580 metres to the North and Sub-Urban Pipe Dream #1 is 1.4km metres to the North East.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;hr color=&quot;#0000FF&quot; /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

However, the well itself was the brainchild of co-owner Alfred Maurice Lewis who wanted the pure, unfiltered water from deep under Wellington Harbour with which to make his company's cordials, ginger beer and aerated water products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1926, he hired Manawatu water diviner Bill Brogden to test the site after geological experts discounted any possibility of artesian water in the capital. Mr Brogden divined water but could not estimate the depth, resulting in Mr Lewis stubbornly drilling to an unheard-of 497 feet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once tested, the water was found to be crystal clear, colourless, and odourless, with a pH of 7.9 and a bacterial count of 0. Despite apparently originating in Wairarapa, its flow has never diminished nor been affected by floods. The only change ever noticed was after the 1929 Murchison earthquake when the water turned slightly cloudy for a short time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p noalign=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/5ce9d95a-a7d6-4e8d-b0d1-0a2814122ce3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, Thomson Lewis and Co's soda water was considered the best and purest in the colonies &#8211; a claim even touted by the medical profession &#8211; securing the company several prestigious contracts, including supplying Wellington Hospital and the Union Steam Ship Company.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table width=&quot;420&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/6cf292b6-f8c8-4efd-8f95-3400a774ca4e.jpg&quot; width=&quot;403&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;This water was used by the beverage maker for 53 years until it was bought out by Coca-Cola. When Moore Wilson took over the site, the well had long been capped, but owner Grahame Moore decided to reinstate it for public use and subsequently commissioned artist Paul Dibble to create an award-winning bronze sculpture &#8211; named &lt;i&gt;From Under the Harbour&lt;/i&gt; - in its honour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The store, which requests that customers take no more than two litres of water at a time, has installed a collection box nearby for voluntary donations. As of November 2011, $4760.50 had been raised for Wellington Free Ambulance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can read more about Thomson Lewis &amp; Co's Wellington factory &lt;a href=&quot;http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP18970517.2.12&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Cyc01Cycl-t1-body-d4-d39-d4.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NB: Placed with Moore Wilson's permission, though you actually do not need to enter its premises. The cache is accessible day or night from the footpath on College Street. Please be discreet when visiting during business hours. Co-ordinates may be +/-5 metres out due to the inner-city location. You may need a log removal tool and/or a selection of pens to successfully sign the waterproof sheet provided.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Whilst it was supposed to be an easy day, we still managed to find a few caches with terrain ratings over 3 that resulted in a few walks up and down hills that were not intended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought this cache might take more time to secure but we found it relatively easy.

Visitors making the trek to Red Rocks and the seals at Sinclair Head will be able to find out more about the South Coast by checking out the displays in the new purpose-built shelter adjacent to the car park.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/be10edf1-244a-4a28-a106-c1217943544a.jpg&quot; /&gt; </groundspeak:short_description>

Inside it has information panels, which have been funded by a Ministry of Tourism grant, about the geology of the area, flora and fauna, shipwrecks, the former quarry operations, the old baches and the planned marine reserve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The upgraded entrance area has been landscaped with rocks, recycled timbers and locally sourced native plants and features new viewing spots, picnic areas and places where groups can gather before and after walks. It also has public toilets, which will be open seven days a week, from 7.00am to 6.00pm in winter, and slightly longer in summer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;The building itself will be open seven days, 9.00am to 4.00pm in winter and 9.00am to 6.00pm during daylight saving months.&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the gateway to an important part of the South Coast and a major entrance to the Te Kopahou Reserve and every year thousands of people will pass through on their way to Red Rocks, the seal colony at Sinclair Head and beyond so it is a great opportunity to learn a little more about the area and its history if you want to. It will also be a great resource for locals, schools and tourists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Council's brought and close the Owhiro Bay Quarry combined with the restoration work that had happened since 2000, together helping native plants and marine life in the area to recover.&lt;/p&gt; http://www.wellington.govt.nz/projects/ongoing/owhirobay.html &lt;h4&gt;Original cache contents&lt;/h4&gt; Logbook, pen, pencil &amp; sharpener &lt;br /&gt; Spinning Top &lt;br /&gt; Glass Fish Pebble &lt;br /&gt; Civil Defence emergency guide &lt;br /&gt; Rugby players cards &lt;h3&gt;Please come here and enjoy this spot all correspondence and pictures are gratefully appreciated&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please replace the cache back exactly how it was found as this is a very high muggle location we definitely don't want it to go missing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;table width=&quot;60%&quot;&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/63c6dac7-4e2f-4e10-8e75-f643fb402b4d.jpg&quot; width=&quot;110&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/0a3e25b6-5ccd-4bcf-ae86-ef6bb52ba70d.jpg&quot; width=&quot;110&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/dd43603c-e627-41f1-936b-f8ed9066521a.jpg&quot; width=&quot;110&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;font size=&quot;+1.1&quot; color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Skytracker&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1.1&quot; color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;huhugrub&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1.1&quot; color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Punga and Paua&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">Today's plan was to do Tapu Te Ranga and Octopus Garden. I even brought down some of my dive gear which might make it easy. But I locked myself out of the house at 7am, and my sister, where I am staying is off for the weekend, back tonight. Ok, so what do I have besides the clothes I am wearing? My cellphone. That's it. No wallet, no keys, no money, no GPS. What to do?? Go caching!&lt;br /&gt;Download the map tiles and the local caches into the phone, put it into airplane mode as the gps functions really suck battery on this model, wander over to a nearby cache and steal its pencil (thanks, bkj97, by the way), steal the advertising insert from the morning paper, which has a blank back, to use as a notebook and off I go! Will have to save the Island and the underwater cache for a later time.&lt;br /&gt;So I wandered around the coast to here. What an amazing place. Last time I was here the quarry was still here. Yeah, okay, that was about 35 years ago. I'm an old Seagnoid. This is a vast improvement. Although the cache hide wasn't. After I signed hte log I spent some time doing some CITO work. Much better. Then spent ages reading the display. Don't take me to a museum - you'll be waiting all day!&lt;br /&gt;- Geocoin, + favourite.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">TFC, great views. :) However, just a word of warning someone had left a piece of &quot;treasure&quot; with a website and a picture of a monster but once I visited the website and looked up the name of the monster, it led to something sickeningly rude. Even as an adult, I've never come across something so disturbing. Glad a child didn't find it! Shame someone put something so disgusting inside the cache!</groundspeak:text>

Celebrating Island Bay's Italian heritage. &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;San Constanzo&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt; is 2 of 3 tribute caches to Island Bay's Italian fishing community. &lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/ae08a0eb-7f88-4d25-b11b-8fb653588bc9.jpg&quot; /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Island Bay's Italian immigrants came from the fishing villages at Massalubrense in the Gulf of Naples and the island of Stromboli off Sicily and many of their boats were named after saints - &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;San Antonio, San Constanzo and San Liberatore.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/3814fe86-362d-4f4d-a68c-36610d6b7a75.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;The blessing of fishing boats is a tradition in Italy that goes back centuries.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/b1a413ca-cabd-4599-bd99-aac79634409c.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;In southern Italy, where most of Island Bay's Italian immigrants are from, the blessing would be undertaken by the local priest at the start of spring. The boats would be decorated in flags and bunting and would file past to have holy water sprinkled on them while the priest recited prayers and made the sign of the cross. The blessing was part of the religious belief that if the boats received the grace of God, they and the fishermen would be protected from the sea and the weather and would also reap the bounty of the sea. The first ceremony in Island Bay was not a blessing of the then thriving fleet anchored in the bay but a commemoration service undertaken by parish priest Father Maloney in 1933 following the loss of one of the launches in a storm at Baring Head and the crew of three, two of whom were Italian. In later years the blessing of the fleet has been undertaken by Archbishop McKeefry, Bishop Snedden and the Apostolic Delegate for New Zealand and the Islands of the Pacific, Archbishop Magnoni. They were performed either on the diving platform about 10 metres out or from the beach at Island Bay.&lt;/font&gt; Extract taken from: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.islandbay.net.nz/&quot;&gt;IslandBayFestival Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/3e1aa8e8-e92c-4c65-9c1d-19ca587b8011.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/41ea5dbf-31db-4c61-b52f-14efafa4d1f3.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;CacheNotes: To access this cache - please swing rather than lift/pull.

Celebrating Island Bay's Italian heritage. &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;San Liberatore&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt; is 3 of 3 tribute caches to Island Bay's Italian fishing community.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/ed894625-8067-4a0f-831a-7c038615f75c.jpg&quot; /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Island Bay's Italian immigrants came from the fishing villages at Massalubrense in the Gulf of Naples and the island of Stromboli off Sicily and many of their boats were named after saints - &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;San Antonio, San Constanzo and San Liberatore.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;The blessing of fishing boats is a tradition in Italy that goes back centuries.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/b1a413ca-cabd-4599-bd99-aac79634409c.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;In southern Italy, where most of Island Bay's Italian immigrants are from, the blessing would be undertaken by the local priest at the start of spring. The boats would be decorated in flags and bunting and would file past to have holy water sprinkled on them while the priest recited prayers and made the sign of the cross. The blessing was part of the religious belief that if the boats received the grace of God, they and the fishermen would be protected from the sea and the weather and would also reap the bounty of the sea. The first ceremony in Island Bay was not a blessing of the then thriving fleet anchored in the bay but a commemoration service undertaken by parish priest Father Maloney in 1933 following the loss of one of the launches in a storm at Baring Head and the crew of three, two of whom were Italian. In later years the blessing of the fleet has been undertaken by Archbishop McKeefry, Bishop Snedden and the Apostolic Delegate for New Zealand and the Islands of the Pacific, Archbishop Magnoni. They were performed either on the diving platform about 10 metres out or from the beach at Island Bay.&lt;/font&gt; Extract taken from: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.islandbay.net.nz/&quot;&gt;IslandBayFestival Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/3e1aa8e8-e92c-4c65-9c1d-19ca587b8011.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src= &quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/41ea5dbf-31db-4c61-b52f-14efafa4d1f3.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;CacheNotes: To access this cache - please swing rather than lift/pull.

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;h2&gt;Viva Italia&lt;/h2&gt; &#160;&lt;br /&gt; Between you and me, I haven't watched a full game of rugby since the last Rugby World Cup - live or on TV. I just don't want my heart broken again. &lt;p&gt;But when the Italian rugby team use Nelson as their Rugby World Cup 2011 base to face Russia and the USA, they aren't too far from home. Right across the road from Trafalgar Park is Club Italia - est. 1931 (no less!) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theprow.org.nz/la-bella-vita/&quot;&gt;Click here for the Nelson Museum's take on Nelson and Italy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/8a9aa872-98de-4a28-b260-e7180d0acb6b.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Azzurri&lt;/i&gt; took part in the first-ever Rugby World Cup match against New Zealand on 22 May 1987. The match proved a one-sided affair with New Zealand convincing 70-6 winners against a young Italian side. John Kirwan, later to become the Italian national coach, scored one of the tournament's greatest tries for the All Blacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So New Zealanders have already had quite a relationship with Italian rugby, and now, us Nelsonians have adopted Italy as our home team for the 2011 Rugby World Cup.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Viva Italia!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(bring a pen/cil.)&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">For a time, the parking area near this cache was opened up by the Nelson City Council to so-called 'Freedom Campers'. Initially temporary portable toilets were in place but more recently brand shiny new permanent facilities have been built here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in the meantime, the council would appear to have had a change of heart and since May 2011, Freedom Camping is forbidden anywhere in Nelson - (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nelsoncitycouncil.co.nz/freedom-camping/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;visit link&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this area has gained some new facilities which are quite nicely decorated and now a cache as well. There is plenty of space to run around and a skate park as well if you are into that sort of thing. I certainly remember bringing my sons here when they were going through their 'Skater Dawg' phases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The area can be highly muggle prone so care and stealth will be required on retrieval and replacement of the cache. Otherwise it should be a pretty straightforward find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cache is a nano container with log only so do bring your own writing device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy&#x2026;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually we take Sunshine somewhat for granted in Nelson. However, this was placed a few days after the heaviest rain in an urban area in New Zealand so the return of Sunshine was very welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have had a Spring song series and this can be seen as part of it &#x2013; a simple park and grab. However, at the time it was placed a lot of the walking tracks were closed so you could alternatively park and grab here and walk to GC39EVW (Sailing) which is about 1km away. The terrain would be 1.5 for the walk to the other cache. Of course, there are other caches in the area which are walking distance from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes the cache is a nano &#x2013; and the area can be quite busy. But if you can sit and think then you should be able to also get a smiley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise take the chance to enjoy what we hope will be sunshine on the water looking so lovely while you wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the usual warnings about taking care of juniors near water apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please indicate in your log when the log has 5 or fewer spaces left.</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Some people have said it feels like private property - The College is happy for the cache to be there. People come and go through the church property all the time so don't worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people don't know this college exists, it offers full and part time degree courses, and is run by a trust board closely linked with the Anglican Diocese of Nelson. TeamElliottFamily finished our studies here in November 2010, so thought a cache was a good way to offer a tribute to a place which has been a huge part of our lives for three years. BTC trains lay people for ordination in the Anglican church (I was one of the first students ordained) and to equip lay people to help in their parishes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the plaques and get a sense of the history - the college was orginally hosted up at Bishopdale Chapel in the late 1800's, but was closed after the first world war. At one time Bishopdale College trained the majority of Anglican clergy in NZ, but this has subsequently been taken over by St John's College in Auckland. Recently Nelson has re-staked our claim (take that Aucklanders).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be discreet, the College has neighbours at the night shelter who are often about in the evenings and obviously students coming to and from classes. This cache will be easiest to get at on a Saturday, but you can easily pick it up on an evening stroll. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cache container is soldily in place and can not be removed, so don't try and yank it off!</groundspeak:long_description>

I didn't feel like back tracking to grab it as it was already late so I left it.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I was in town by myself it was to get petrol, so I made sure when I was heading the correct direction to pull in and grab it. Only it seemed someone else was getting petrol. Without any idea as to how long it would take to fill the petrol tank in a bus I decided to go fill my own car's tank and ended up following the bus into town.&lt;br /&gt;I didn't get another chance to hunt it as most of my time was spent out Stoke direction.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe next time I'm in town I'll have better luck.</groundspeak:text>

I thought I was going to have to contact Sidewaze &amp; hand in the cache in person since I was not having any luck putting it back. Gave the muggles in the parking lot an odd show.

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Simonet Creek flows into Apple Tree Bay about 3.5 km along the coastal track from the Marahau end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've placed this cache a shortish creek hop up the creek to encourage a bit of off track exploration. I didn't measure how far up the creek I went exactly. The bridge is certainly out of site from where the cache is. I went about as far as I could before reaching quite a broad pool. Its probably about 100m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be able to avoid getting your feet wet on the way but it may also just be easier to splash on up the stream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take great care as you go as some of the rocks are quite slippery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cache is a 400ml Sistema container with log, pencil, eraser and room for small swaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GPS reception not great near the cache site so when you get close here's the scene looking upstream. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a broad part of the stream or a pool in front of you which you probably couldn't get across without getting wet. To your right there are a few round boulders. Clamber up to the right and look in the steep walls for a rocky crevice, roughly V shaped. There is a loose rock covering a hole where the cache is resting.</groundspeak:long_description>

They will be set on the way to or near to popular family destinations (where you will often also find a cache). They are themed around a rhyme and are aimed especially at preschoolers.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The intention is for the YO (youngest one) to make the find. The caches will all be 1 litre (or more), in a camoed material bag, should be very easily found and, when placed, included a variety of swaps. There will be safe off road parking and the area should not be busy. So your YO should be able to follow the arrow, find the cache and find a swap, without muggles around.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;Please do not put Travel bugs or coins in these caches.&lt;/u&gt; We don&apos;t want disappointed YO&apos;s who can&apos;t keep their choice of item.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Please let us know if the coordinates seem to be wrong or if there is any other problem with the cache. The idea is to have happy junior cachers.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; For YAH&apos;s (young at hearts) they are a park and grab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache is placed near the start of a walk that carries on beside water. There is a grassed area for parking and the GPS should take your YO to the start of the track and then along the well formed track to near GZ. The cache is about 25m into the bush area and slightly off track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The coordinates were the best we could do given the tree cover. If you have better ones, please post them. They should take your YO near to GZ. The cache hint will give you the rest if you need to prompt them at the end. You can carry on along the track with the usual warning about juniors near water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One, two, three, four, five,&lt;br /&gt; Once I caught a fish alive,&lt;br /&gt; Six, seven, eight, nine, ten,&lt;br /&gt; Then I let it go again.&lt;br /&gt; Why did you let it go?&lt;br /&gt; Because it bit my finger so.&lt;br /&gt; Which finger did it bite?&lt;br /&gt; This little finger on my right.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I think you'll understand the cache name when you get to the cache site.</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">One of the joys of caching is the times it takes you to wonderful places in the great outdoors. Tramping (hiking for non-kiwis) in these accessible and not-so-accessible places can be fun for all ages. From short walks to day walks to multi-day tramps there is something for everyone out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache is placed at one of the many footbridges along the Abel Tasman coastal track. This track is well formed and rolls its way around the coast without ever getting too steep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the time of year you could be sharing the track with lots of other walkers from all over the world. So be aware of muggles approaching from different directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's about 1.5 - 2 hours walk from the track start in Marahau.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is a 400ml Sistema container with log, pencil, eraser and room for small swaps.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">After staying the night in Arthurs Pass, today we made our way to Westport, collecting several caches along the way. Unfortunately the weather wasn&#x2019;t as good as yesterday, so we got fairly wet finding caches today! Curious Weka indeed, just where we parked a Weka came to visit us, we were waiting for the tourists to vacate their cars at GZ, but this was overshadowed by the little fellow that came to join us. He was more intent on pulling the stones out of the bank than of getting in our car though, got some good pics though. Quick find once we made it the few cars down we needed to be.</groundspeak:text>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On this site October 1st 1864 John Hudson and James Price opened Hokitika's first store, a 12 x 20 feet building of saplings and calico. The gold rushes soon followed and Hudson and Price were ideally situated to cash in on the influx of diggers. Price later returned to England but Hudson remained to watch the emergence of the town he had founded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are looking for a camo micro possible nano container.</groundspeak:long_description>

Found while taking in the local sight in and around the town. No muggles around at the GC to see what 1eyednbf (one eyed and proud of it) was up to. Nice hide, TFTC [:)]</groundspeak:text>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On the 6th of November 1965, this section of highway was opened, connecting Westland directly with Otago. There is a memorial here to commemorate the opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, most people come here for the absolutely fantastic views. Lots of buses and many tourists! Thank heavens for the large stone statue which somewhat hides what a geocacher would be doing behind the wooden railing! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some substantial drops nearby, so I am going to insist that you read a few hints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Do NOT let any children go behind the railing (there's about 10 clear metres before a drop)&lt;br /&gt;2) The cache is within HALF A METRE of the railing.&lt;br /&gt;3) There are TWO rocks, which you must sight before collecting the cache - the cache is behind the left-most rock (which is the smaller of the two).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original cache is a 600mL click clack container with:&lt;br /&gt;Winnie stamp&lt;br /&gt;Dinosaur&lt;br /&gt;Pirate Lanyard&lt;br /&gt;...as well as logbook, pencils, etc</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You are looking for a 500ml screw top plastic container hidden on the foreshore of Lake Wanaka Note; this is a very high muggle zone - but the advantage is that there is a lot of parking.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">Took 2 visits to find this one, with lots of frustrating searching involved. The first visit there was a muggle sittind at GZ supervising the pedestrian crossing. We explained what we were doing and it turned out he was also a geocacher so he had a quick look with us. No luck so we left it as unfound. Had an opportunity to come back the next day and some more frustrating searching later we eventually managed to track it down and retrieve it with a simpple tool I had in my caching bag. Log was disintergrating so I have taken a photo of the cache instead. Thanks for a very challenging cache.</groundspeak:text>

She was trying to boost his business so he wouldn't cancel his listing (it didn't work). This was one of our stops on the tour. The Knickerbocker Hotel has a pretty grisly history and is reportedly haunted by Rudolph Valentino and Marilyn Monroe, neither of whom could be any more lifeless than our tour guide was!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0in;border:none;padding:0in;line-height:0.19in;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#594A42&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, sans-serif&quot;&gt;You can read more about The Knickerbocker's haunted history here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prairieghosts.com/hollywood7.html&quot;&gt;http://www.prairieghosts.com/hollywood7.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0in;border:none;padding:0in;line-height:0.19in;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#594A42&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, sans-serif&quot;&gt;The cache is a narrow mint tin about six inches long.

This is our last day in the area for this trip, we are moving tomorrow but I have a feeling we will be back there is just to much stuff to do not to come back, we visited the Ghost town and picked up a few odds and ends today, we did a great set of caches ( Phonetic Alphabet) we really enjoyed them what with all the hiking and the differant type's of caches to find. I would like to thank all the CO's in the area for all the hard work they have put into all the caches.</groundspeak:text>

Located near the epicenter of the famous Haight-Ashbury, their theme is heavily Grateful Dead-centric. Even the name of the pub is derived from a Grateful Dead song.</groundspeak:long_description>

The falls were reportedly inspired by outdoor pioneer John Muir and were paid for in 1894 by railroad magnate Collis Huntington as a gift to the city. Plunging into Stow Lake, the rushing water is a haven for the egrets, great blue herons, and other birds that make the lake their home. For more exploration, hire a paddle boat and cruise around or cross the bridge to get a better look at the falls. Climb up to the top and soak it all in. Mr. Muir would approve.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Cache container is a M258A1 Military Decontamination (Decon) Box. This cache also has a 46 ounce Lock-N-Lock as a cache container.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This cache contains an irwinSports pathtag for FTF.&lt;br /&gt; Congratulations to Team 5-12 on FTF.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Congratulations to Gnome-Mad on your first GC find. 2/28/2009&lt;br /&gt; Congratulations to jmulvey05 on your first GC find. 9/6/2009&lt;br /&gt; Congratulations to awysong on your first GC find. 12/25/2010&lt;br /&gt; Congratulations to luckylos510 on your first GC find. 3/16/2011&lt;br /&gt; Congratulations to cheimonette on your first GC find. 5/22/2011</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">Both my phone and TLB's phone were now dead, but the GPSr showed this cache not too far away. Matthew had the GPSr again, and he led us up to the lake, although Traveling Ladybug was unsure about the dirt steps cut into the hill. Then, we followed him to the bottom of the waterfall, and the kids started to climb the rocks, until I pleaded with them to stay on the trail. Good thing, the last 152 feet turned out to be quite a climb. Once on site, this cache proved to be harder than the first three, but Matthew eventually found the hiding place and was rewarded with a gnome of his own. Left a geocoin. Went to some dessert place on Irving to celebrate afterward.&lt;br /&gt;{2/2s,gr}</groundspeak:text>

  <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;[Needs maintenance]&lt;br /&gt;Fanny Bridge</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Coordinates are within a 39 feet range of error. Elevation is 6264.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When visiting Tahoe city, Lake Tahoe, you can't miss famed Fanny Bridge. It was humorously named for that part of the anatomy that's most visible when people bend to peer into the Truckee River, hoping for a glimpse of the giant rainbow trout that swim there. You can feed the fish and watch the seagulls race to beat the fish to the food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look above the fish and you can see Lake Tahoe's only water outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of construction that made our last cache disappear, we placed this new cache approximately 200 feet away from, but within sight of the bridge. The cache is harder to find than the original one and will be challenging to new geo-cachers. Because this is a vacation spot and some geo-cachers may not be coming by a second time, I have given a 'very' helpful hint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you log this GeoCache, feel free to share photos of the people peering over the bridge. Also, please tell us what city and state or country you are from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to visit the nearby historical museum. Admission is no longer free but it is well worth the time spent there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When on the bridge, you can also turn around and see the river rafters (when in season) start their journey down the Truckee River to the River Ranch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: BE AWARE AND VERY CAREFUL OF THE VEHICLE TRAFFIC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benchmarks: If you want to add some benchmark credits to your geo-cache page, there are 6 to 8 benchmarks in the area. Three easy ones are: KS0283 and KS0284 located on each end of the outlet gates and KS0282 located on the bridge walkway on the other side of the street.</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;[Available in winter, stealth required, restrooms available, drinking water nearby, wheelchair accessible, parking available, takes less than 1 hour, kid friendly]&lt;br /&gt;There are several ski/board/hike to caches at Squaw Valley USA Ski Area. Some of these are difficult to obtain. Here's a Squaw Valley cache that may be easier for cachers to find!!</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a micro (smaller than a 35mm film canister) cache that requires a visit to a Historical Monument at Squaw Valley USA Ski Area. The above coords are not for the actual cache site but for the Monument itself.&lt;br /&gt;Here is the way to find the cache: Go to above location, read the Monument info,(This is where the &quot;Tribute&quot; comes in.) then go two paces to your left (south). Go westward and walk under a sign that reads &quot;Special Tickets&quot;. Note: the &quot;Special Tickets&quot; sign is no longer there.&lt;br /&gt;The cache is located on the wall to your right, hidden behind a wireway. Please bring something to write with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have Fun!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I came by to replace the log and found out that the outside climbing wall next to the cache is being used this summer. Congrats to all of you that found the cache with all the muggle activity in the area!&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is a fence that may block the cache somewhat, but it is still able to be found if you are very sly!</groundspeak:long_description>

Give yourself an extra star difficulty if you find it with no GPS, no maps (like the one below), no Google Earth, etc. Resistance is not futile! Have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to old downtown Truckee. Think small green signs atop poles and wander around until the title all comes together. Then use the hint. You're looking for a sandwich size tupperware. (Note: 9/9/09, some entity cut down all the bushes and trees at gz....it's pretty exposed now....muggle factor is now higher).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Did you use the &quot;force&quot;, or was resistance futile?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Congrats, again, to scheibwife for FTF....jeez, only about an hour from published to found....good job.)</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">Took the grandkids to view the Donner and Tahoe Lakes, and grabbed a few caches while in the area. We can certainly attest to the fact that there are big fish near here...as we just visited Fanny Bridge and pitched a few salmon eggs down to the lunkers below. Even the ducks tried to get into the act! Thanks for the nifty cache near the lunker rainbows...</groundspeak:text>

There is no need to interfere with any of the graves or plaques to find this cache.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The old graves are potentialy very unstable and as there is a very real risk of damage or personal injury if they are not treated with care and respect. Therefore please ensure that you do not walk, climb, lean on them or carry out any other actions that may negatively impact on them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache&lt;/b&gt; contains the log only so please bring your own writting implement. At the time of placing my GPS coordiates were with an accuracy of +-6m largely due to the shadow of the hills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you wish to park within the cemetery, then to avoid being locked in please note the gate closing times at the entance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

These boxes can come at you from a number of different directions, so take care...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; At the coordinates look for subject of the title- this is the outer cache- but then the problem is how to get to the actual cache (a pill bottle inside) to sign the log. You will need some additional assistance (available very close by) to retrieve the actual cache - so be prepared for the simple secondary hunt. As always - there are two hints- the first quite cryptic, the second very specific. Use only what you need.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; There is no need to enter or fiddle around with any of the Sub_Urban residences, gardens,cages/fences etc&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The difficulty rating as well as reflecting the camo nature and method of inner cache retrieval also recognises that muggles can turn up at anytime from a few directions. And as with most Dreams (whether Pipe or not), you can't usually get then too fast so as always, extra discretion and patience is required to avoid muggle interference. Timing is important.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Remember to bring your own pen, and put everything back just as you found it for the next person. Also NO SPOILERS of the final location please.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you enjoyed this study of Sub-Urban life, please feel free to explore this topic further by trying another Sub-Urban series cache- Light and Bright Sub-Urban Streets (GC2MM47) is located 300 metres to the west, and Sub-Urban Pipe Dream #1 is 900 metres to the East.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;hr color=&quot;#0000FF&quot; /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">Find #1654. A nice sunny day for a spot of cycle caching in the city. Tried to start early but as the day progressed was thwarted at some caches by the crowds. I recall when this discovery was made and thought at the time how exciting it would be to make such a discovery. I was really pleased they preserved the site in this manner. I ummmed and arrhhed over a few of the questions, some open to interpretation but eventually came up with a set for a suitable location that matched the hint. A quick find after that.

Off to GZ, but struggled to come up with the prize, so had to use the PAF option. Turned out I was looking in the right place but not quite looking hard enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completed the paperwork and took the pathtag to add to my small collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TFTC, gets a favourite from me, and thanks for bringing me to this spot I would never have been aware og.

Along with the neccessary continuing of the caching streak :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to this wee museum last week while I was up here, as I finished work early that day, and so had time to go here before closing. An interesting wee place! Awesome looking at the old photos! (That is totally one of my favourite things... old photos :) ) And kinda cool seeing the remains of old Punga trees too!&lt;br /&gt;But then some of the photos made the questions quite tough to answer. As I think my eyesight is failing me, as when I was counting boats, everything was pretty fuzzy! Either way, ended up with numbers that fitted the check sum... so went to take a look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No luck, no cache... hmmm... while writing up an email to the CO to check my coords, I realised a possible other solution... turns out I was right with the second one!! So went off today to take a look :)&lt;br /&gt;Not too busy today, as it was pouring with rain, so I just took a seat, pretended to be txting, and felt around. Thought it was going to take ages to find, but ended up realising I was pretty much looking at it! Just couldn't see in the dark... wow, what does that say about my eyes... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signed the log, and then covered up and hid a little more covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consecutive caching day # 247&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TFTC!! :)</groundspeak:text>

  <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;[Not wheelchair accessible, no camping, available 24-7, needs maintenance, parking available, takes less than 1 hour, kid friendly]&lt;br /&gt;Finding the Graveyard in Picton is not hard but there are two parking areas. You can walk, bike or drive right from the town centre. There is a bit of slope to most of the area but nothing that most can't handle. Its a nice walk with a bit of eerie history. Take some time to say hello to the Muggles that once were. The Cache has books for Book Crossing as well as a geo-cache treasure swap with the usual trinkets. Larger container to fit books.</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When you see the cemetery, bypass Gravesend Place and go further up the road till you see a -small- cemetery sign. Turn left there and go up to the Terraces. Take a walk along the lowest terrace. The Cache is down from the 2nd tap but up from the two tallest headstones near it. No need to walk on anyone....</groundspeak:long_description>
  <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Behind the headstone for Craddock Beauchamp, look up.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

There's also a crack in the container - suggest if someone's coming by with a bit of duct tape, it wouldn't go amiss. We made the container as sturdy and earwig-tight as we could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mini-BammJams chose a yoyo to take out of the cache, and replaced it with a dice. Cache returned without us seeing any one else in the cemetery. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Cathedral Square, locally known simply as the Square, is the geographical centre and heart of Christchurch, New Zealand, where the city's Anglican cathedral, Christchurch Cathedral is located.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The square stands at the theoretical crossing of two of the city's main streets, Colombo Street and Worcester Street, though in practice both have been either blocked off or detoured around the square itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/dd64d1eb-df59-43b6-8ffb-8e1acbec0d88.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Square has been mostly closed off from the public since 22 Feb 2011 when the city was devastated by a mag 6.1 Earthquake that was centred in the Port Hills, less that 10km from the CDB.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that the public is allowed back into the CDB (with a few cordons still in place) it's time to get another cache out there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cache container is a small Eclipse Mint tin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the past, the Square would have been a very busy area, especially so over the summer months, so there's a good chance there will be people in the are when you are searching for this cache.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please be very stealthy...you may be best to look at the GZ to locate the cache first before diving in at the right moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rated a 2 difficulty due to the potential high pedestrian count.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No room for swaps. Bring your own pen. Please replace carefully, and so it is not easily spotted by people who are unaware of what geocaching is!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nzmega2015.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nzmega2015.com/img/mega_banner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NZ Mega 2015 Banner&quot; title=&quot;Click here to visit the 2015 NZ Mega Website!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">River Gods are male water spirits. As their name states, they only inhabit rivers while water nymphs may inhabit other bodies of water also. One River God is mentioned rising out of the Great River of Narnia with his nymph daughters, and other river gods are mentioned as becoming husbands to the daughters of King Frank and Queen Helen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another River God is mentioned lifting his head from the river with the river nymphs upon hearing Aslan's roar. He appears again and asks Aslan to &quot;loose his chains,&quot; i.e. destroy the bridge that crosses his river at Beruna (MN) (PC). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 2008 film of Prince Caspian, the river god is digitally portrayed as a giant man made entirely out of water with hair and beard made of foam, who rushes at the Telmarines, creating tidal waves and even destroying the bridge. In an illustration in Prince Caspian, the River God is depicted as a giant man with his head crowned with rushes, and covered with swampy muck and moss; however, the River God in The Magician's Nephew is depicted as a normal-sized, elderly man, his head still crowned with rushes, but dressed in a blue robe and a green cloak. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Our world &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The banks of the Avon River.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">We had a 3-week-visit to NZ and on the last day we were in CC. We had caches printed out all over the South Island except for the last day... PAtricia said, while walking at this area,&quot;1 hell of a place to hide a cache!&quot; Which made us looking a bit closer and deeper&lt;br /&gt;And yes! No coordinates at hand, but a find!&lt;br /&gt;The last one in NZ (in the evening we went back to &quot;Good Ole Shanghai&quot;). A lot of people called it an easy catch, but we had a lot of laughter and fun with it. So : TFTC a lot!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MArnix was so jealous that he was searching each three like a vulture in order to equal PAtricia's catch... NO LUCK FOR HIM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had some 60-70 caches found in NZ but this one was definitely memorable....</groundspeak:text>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Geocaching is a sport that takes us into all types of terrains, and we go searching in all types of weather. Usually the geocaching team arrive home safe and sound, although sometimes a little worse for wear, with the occasional cut or bruise, or broken rib. Very occasionally though, this is not the case and we need a little more help to find our way home. This series looks at those people who help those who are lost or hurt, and need help in getting back to where they want to be. Hopefully you will never need to experience the reality of this help first hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;St John's Ambulance &#8211; First to Care&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In a typical year, St John crews travel more than 4.5 million kilometres across the South Island Region (that's the equivalent of going to the moon and back 12 times!). They receive more than 250 111 calls a day and treat more than 100,000 patients a year - that's one patient every five and a half minutes! This area gives them a significant challenge due to the scattered population over a large geographical area, but they maintain their service with 83 ambulance stations located throughout the region. They do a wonderful job!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You are looking for a screwtop container. If you would like to find the final for this series &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=2abacbc0-0a95-4865-96ee-75943fa91c07&quot;&gt;The Helpers: Final GC3WDQC&lt;/a&gt;, please take note of what you find on the log. Cache contained a few small swaps (only these fit), pencil and sharpener. Return covered thanks. Star rating for muggle factor. Trees interfere with GPS.</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache was placed to say thank you to all South Island cachers for placing caches in locations with excellent views and interesting history. Who needs a tour guide if they have a GPS? &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I missed out on a few caches because I didn't understand the hint - look under the Tussock. Under the Flax bush. In the fork of the Cabbage tree. What??? I was imagining a Cabbage tree being a tree with large cabbage-like leaves... and failed to find that cache. As a Queenslander, I'm used to figs, pandanus trees and bottle trees, to name just a couple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you can check yourself if I've identified a tussock bush - because this cache is surrounded by tussock. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to add to your logs any hints you found difficult to understand in other countries/states. We could start a dictionary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is a 200ml container, and when hidden contained three geocoins as well as a few Aussie flags on toothpicks, a padlock, wrist band, toy soldiers, a stubby holder, mobile phone pouch, small torch, toy car and a Sesame Street character (the guy who keeps counting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to hoskina for maintaining, and for relocating as my original spot was too close to other waypoints! Also thanks to GYARGH for replacing and moving it slightly when this cache was discovered by locals.&lt;br /&gt;And, a big thank you to 8ManAfter for replacing it in January 2012!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own pen.</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In the World of Narnia - Tree People are wood gods and goddesses who use their trees as their physical bodies. They are described as beautiful giants and giantesses who have branch-like hair and fingers. They have roots for feet and wade in the earth like humans do in water. A whole swarm of trees dance sleepily around Lucy and Aslan when they are reunited, and even aid the Old Narnian Army in defeating the Telmarines. During the Hundred Years' Winter, many tree spirits turned evil and joined the White Witch's side, I think I saw a brightly coloured one handing out tickets and I don&#x2019;t think they were lucky ones. However generations later, they aid the Old Narnian Army in defeating the Telmarines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Our world - Protestant martyrs &lt;br /&gt;In 1555 Mary I, a Roman Catholic, ordered three of the leading Protestant bishops, Cranmer, Latimer and Ridley, to be burned at the stake. These men were the first of the Protestant martyrs in England, who died because of their religious beliefs. Three of the squares in Christchurch were supposed to be named after them, but Ridley Square became Cathedral Square instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first stone churches in Christchurch, St John the Baptist Anglican church, was built on the edge of Latimer Square in 1864.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1860 Latimar Square was uncultivated. The Tree People arrived here in the 1870&#x2019;s to 1880&#x2019;sA letter from secretary of the Albion Cricket Club was sent to the Chairman of the Municipal Council requesting the use of Latimer Square as a cricket pitch, July 1862. The square was not at this time bisected by Worcester Street. The club ploughed up the entire square and sowed English grasses. And in 1885 a band rotunda was in the middle. (and a pie cart until a few year ago).</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">As we were in the area, this cache was irresistible, especially when we went to investigate what all the action was in this well-known square. As well as a cache, we managed to get a great glimpse of the 2014 CBD Stampede participants as they went through their paces. Looked equal parts great fun and hard work! Luckily, cache placement was out of the way of all the huffing and puffing, although we still had to manage our timing and body placement to make the grab! All done without too much trouble. Thanks for the cache and bringing us here on our last day in town, Aslan*. Happy New Year! Cheers!</groundspeak:text>

You can do each as a traditional cache, or if you want to complete the final, please take note of the colour and item of the plastic fishing-related item in each cache, the series number and the fish mentioned, but please return item to cache container for the next person.&lt;br /&gt; The final is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=08717048-8a3b-4704-959a-029eaf777746&quot;&gt;Fishing Fun Final&lt;/a&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;This cache has been muggled and the fishing-related item has gone. Please take note of what is on the top of the log so you can complete the final thanks.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;p&gt;The earthquakes Christchurch has suffered from since 2010 onwards have also affected the waterways of the area, destroying habitat needed for our native fish. Each cache will take you to a waterway, or a water-themed street. The series was released into the wild during New Zealand Sea Week 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Common Smelt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These are small fish that shimmer and live in large shoals in estuaries and lowland rivers, although they spend most of their lives at sea. Some return to the waterways when they are young in spring. If whitebaiters catch these, they call them cucumber fish because they smell really strongly of fresh cucumbers. Most of these fish return to our estuaries when they are adults measuring about 10cm. If you are lucky you might even see one in a lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You are looking for a screwtop container. Please bring your own pen. Please ensure cache is replaced so it can't be seen as it's now been muggled three times, thanks&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third cache in the Rangiora to Oxford Line series. You are looking for an Eclipse tin.</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On a Geocaching trip around South Canterbury and North Otago in January 2012 we did a series of geocaches by erninz, based on the now-extinct Kurow to Oamaru Railway. Inspired by this great series we decided that this year we would put up a similar series based on the old Rangiora to Oxford Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was part of the Canterbury Interior Main Line, proposed in the 1870&#x2019;s, that was to link many of the branch lines in the Canterbury region. Specifically these were the Oxford, Eyreton, Midland, Whitecliffs, Methven and Mount Somers branch lines. Although the idea never came to full fruition this most northerly part was constructed and operated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rangiora to Oxford portion was opened on 21 June 1875 and closed on 19 April 1959. The Oxford to Sheffield portion was opened on 28 July 1884 and closed on 14 July 1930.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rangiora-Oxford line provided a link between the Main North Line at Rangiora and the Midland Line at Sheffield, passing over the Waimakariri River at a purpose-built rail/road bridge (now the Waimakariri Gorge Road Bridge). The main purpose of the line was to support the growing timber industry in the Oxford area. Oxford and Little River at that time had the two most significant stands of timber in Canterbury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the opening of the Rangiora-Oxford line the train travelled from the Rangiora Station to the Oxford West Station for the celebrations. Unfortunately all the dignitaries were assembled at the Oxford East Station and watched the train go straight past! However, the error was communicated to the driver and the train soon returned to the correct station.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The line operated two mixed trains (passengers and freight) each way daily. An evening train also travelled to Oxford from the Eyreton branch line. This line had stations at such places as Kaiapoi, Mandeville, Swannanoa, Horrelville and West Eyreton. But that is another story (and possible series). The Last Train to Clarkeville immediately comes to mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stations along the whole Rangiora Oxford Line were, in order, Rangiora, Bells, Fernside, Stoke, Springbank (Moeraki), Cust, Bennetts Junction (where the Eyreton branch joined it), Carleton, Oxford East, Oxford West, View Hill, Bexley and Sheffield (Malvern). The length of the line, from Rangiora to Oxford West, was 35.47 km and it was a single track, 1.0677mm (3ft 6in) gauge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further information on the Rangiora-Oxford Line is available from Beyond the Waimakariri by D N Hawkins, Exploring New Zealand&#x2019;s Ghost Railways by Leitch and Scott or online by googling Rangiora-Oxford Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are still many points along the adjacent Rangiora-Cust-Oxford road where you can see evidence of the old line &#x2013; signs, culverts, embankments, reserves and goods sheds. We have attempted to place a cache at or near every station between Rangiora and the Waimakariri Gorge. There are twelve caches altogether &#x2013; all park and grab. In some cases they are not at the exact spot for various reasons, which will be explained on a cache by cache basis. The alternative sites are in the area and at a relevant/interesting spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each chosen site has an Eclipse tin containing a log sheet, geocaching notice, silica crystal sachet, two pencils and a pencil sharpener. At the top of the log sheet is the name and number of a character from Thomas the Tank Engine books. Remember to read and record that information carefully for a future puzzle cache. (Beside the Line) Please be aware of muggles and return the container to its original position.</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;[Available 24-7, picnic tables available, recommended for tourists, restrooms available, parking available, stealth required, bikes allowed, dogs allowed]&lt;br /&gt;Close to the Hamner Springs Township on Jacks Pass Rd is the Hanmer Springs Recreational Hub where people can try their skills on the skateboard/BMX park, hone their skills on the tennis court and the kids can play on the play ground. In the summer time the domain can be used for a game of cricket and during winter the odd game of rugby is played. If golf is your game the Hanmer Springs golf coarse surround the recreational area and nearby you can try your hand in lawn mini golf.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Over the years I have brought the kids here to play on the play ground, run around the domain and generally explore the wooded area.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The domain is also the focal point for various sorting events including the Hanmer Springs MTB Series, the Hanmer Holiday Homes Alpine Marathon, the Alpine Holiday Homes DownHill Dash and the domain is also the finish line for the Rainbow Rage MTB race which I have competed in twice now. A challenging but enjoyable ride through some stunning remote alpine terrain.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This geocache been created to give visitors to Hanmer Springs the opportunity to see a part of Hanmer Springs that is often overlooked (easy walking distance from the town centre). Take a wee walk along the pathway that meanders between the tall trees, keep an eye out you may even locate the geocache. Hope you get the chance to visit this recreational area and enjoy the time invested there. You will need to take a pen along with you.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">Our final cache of the day, and our last day in the area, so glad it was a memorable find! Loved seeing the eyes of the younger Tiger Shark light up, when he found the Bagginses TB in the container. Gotta love geocaching when that sort of thing happens [:D] Plus, it made a 'sticky' retrieve and replacement of the cache worthwhile! Fancied that taking one good TB from the cache deserved replacement, so left our Aussie TB friend in its place. Hope it's on it's way to more adventures soon. Thanks for all your caching work, Hello Mrs. Happy 2014! Cheers! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This entry was edited by Ninja Wasabi on Thursday, 02 January 2014 at 10:17:04 UTC.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">Had our geocaching fix for the day, thanks to our local rellies, the Tiger Shark team. It was great to have them showing us some of the region's cool caches on our last day's stay. This was our first find of the morning. A nice straight forward cache, true to description. All good at GZ. Signed log, took nothing, left nothing.Thanks for the cache, HeyTopps. Hope you're having a great 2014 so far. Much appreciated, cheers! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This entry was edited by Ninja Wasabi on Thursday, 02 January 2014 at 09:55:28 UTC.</groundspeak:text>

Had a friendly muggle with me so couldn't muck around too much.&lt;br /&gt;A quick find here (have checked google street view and am sure it was here and not down the road, but when I do the run will stop again and check) and we were back on the road, without doing the Harwarden circuit.&lt;br /&gt;Another excuse for a day out sometime.

  <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;[Needs maintenance]&lt;br /&gt;The cache was placed at low tide via a walk along the beach. It may pose some problems to find using this method at high tide. However, the cache is close to where one can drive to and beside a walking track that would eventually lead to Adderly Head which is opposite Godley Head. Permission must be gained from the farm house at the end of the road to use the walking track.</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is named in respect of a NZ comedy duo. The cache is about 1.5l size and camo painted. When placed it contained log book, pencil and sharpener along with a variety of swaps including 2 3d animal puzzles, large scented candle and small candle, bubbles and a few other items that I can't recall. the road from Purau to the cache site is not sealed and requires careful transition, but it is fine for all vehicle types.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">#3535 @1440&lt;br /&gt;In Auckland for a family reunion and a mountain bike orienteering competition. Visiting Rangitoto Island was high on the list of todos. After collecting the first 3 caches of the Geocaching Licence Challenge Series and the CANZ - Auckland cache my phone battery was too low to do any more caching so I decided to head down and catch the earlier ferry. I knew there were some caches on the way but had no way of knowing where they were. I stopped here on the way down as it looked like a likely place. Sure enough I managed to find it after some muggles had moved on. Found without the aid of a GPS and the hint. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

One cache in this series is hidden in each of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_New_Zealand&quot;&gt;16 official regions of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each North Island Regional Cache contains a numeric code that will help you locate a Semi-Final North Island Cache located somewhere in the North Island. Similarly, each South Island Regional Cache contains a numeric code that will help you locate a Semi-Final South Island Cache located somewhere in the South Island.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each Semi-Final Island Cache contains a numeric code that will lead you to the NZ Final Cache located somewhere in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;text-align:justify;background-color:#FFFFFF;padding:10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About This Cache:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CANZ Auckland is hidden on Rangitoto Island, one of the most recognisable icons of the Auckland region. This island is a 5.5 km wide distinctive symmetrical shield volcano cone rising 260 metres high over the Hauraki Gulf. Rangitoto is the most recent and the largest (2311 hectares) of the approximately 50 volcanoes of the Auckland Volcanic Field and was formed by a series of eruptions between 550 and 600 years ago. The volcano is not expected to become active again.&lt;br /&gt; About 200 metres from the top of the mountain on the eastern side visitors can walk through some of about seven known lava tubes &#8212; tubes left behind after the passage of liquid lava. These tubes are cave-like and the longest is about 50 metres long.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; There are virtually no streams on the island so plants rely on rainfall for moisture. It has the largest forest of Pohutukawa trees in the world. In total, more than 200 species of trees and flowers thrive on the island, including several species of orchid, as well as more than 40 types of fern.&lt;br /&gt; The island is considered especially significant because all stages from raw lava fields to scrub establishment and sparse forests are visible. As lava fields contain no soil of the typical kind, windblown matter and slow breaking-down processes of the native flora are still in the process of transforming the island into a more habitable area for most plants.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/81d0f5ec-4f49-44fb-9d06-7466aa47ca73.jpg?rnd=0.4190012&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A moat-like ring around the crater summit (clearly visible as the dips on either side of the summit) was created when the entire summit subsided back down the throat of the volcano during the cooling process. This sheltered, moister area was one of the first parts of the island to be colonized by plants. It now has some of the most diverse forest on the island and some of the most picturesque tracks. The cache is hidden on one of these tracks, off the trail to the lava tubes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The track up to the summit has recently been upgraded and is a relatively easy walk, as is the track out to the cache. The fastest way from the cache to the summit is to continue past the cache site. This takes you along a short section of track with a marginally higher terrain rating, to the road and then along the boardwalk which winds around and up to the top, with great views along the way.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; There are several daily ferries to the island from Auckland's main ferry terminal. These allow day trips to walk to the summit and back, with stunning views of the harbour and city, and to find some of the many caches on the island.&lt;/p&gt; The cache is an ammo can hidden in a small rock cave visible from the track. No need to stand on any vegetation or unstable rock to reach GZ. There is a small ready-to-place camoed systema as a prize for the first to find. Plenty of room for swaps and trackables.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;You are encouraged to include pictures with your log (just no spoilers).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;background-color:#FFCC66;padding:10pt;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;CANZ Series Maintained by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=8ManAfter&quot;&gt;8ManAfter&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=rediguana&quot;&gt;rediguana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache was one of the main reasons for visiting Rangitoto (though I suspect we will struggle to find a number of other NI CANZ caches in the foreseeable future). A nice shady part of the island.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">The forecast for the day looked good, so we decided to visit Rangitoto to pick up the CANZ Auckland cache, as well as an island trig cache for a trig bagging challenge in Wellington. &lt;br /&gt;We made hard work of this as we left the path too early, and had to use the hint to find the cache. When we returned to the path, it was easy to spot where the cache was hidden. Good spot for an ammo can, suits the environment. &lt;br /&gt;Objective one achieved, now objective two, most relieved.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">I'm visiting from Melbourne for the New Zealand Mega which means finding lots of caches and coming here especially to find this one [:)] - the whole experience has been fantastic. The weather has also been much nicer than back in Melbourne and that has meant long hours starting early and caching late into the night and not getting much sleep in between. I had spent many hours in the lead up to my arrival in New Zealand preparing an itinerary of caches, solved puzzles and places I wanted to visit and I'm pleased to say I completed just about everything I had planned. For the places I didn't get to visit, well that just means I'm gonna come back. I've seen stunning sights, walked lots of kilometres (and driven even more) met some great people and made new friends which has been awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks kiwicouple for bringing me here and for adding to my positive experience.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">We had never cached north of Auckland international airport so there were a zillion caches to choose from while we were in Auckland for the Mega. We chose to do the Mega group walk on Rangitoto. It was a perfect day weatherwise, the group were great to stroll with and chat to and of course there were a few caches to find as well. Despite tired legs and feet we thoroughly enjoyed the day and our thanks to the cache placers and our guides for the experience. [:D]</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">Have done a few of this series now..... probably will mean some travel to complete the rest! When we decided to come to the mega the trip to Rangitoto was the first priority on our list. It didn't disappoint. Despite the terrain and our senior years taking their toll on our bodies we were up for the challenge. (just) It was pleasing to see that some of the others in the group were as tired as we were at the end of the day. Great company, great scenery and a most enjoyable day. Day one of the MEGA with the Rangitoto group walk. Thanks to Phasevisitor and Jacksonz for being our guides.</groundspeak:text>

Absolutely beautiful day today, perfect for a walk around the island, and perfect for a relaxing rest stop on this here bench.

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When we walked the&#160;road from the summit down to McKenzie Bay there was only one cache to find on the way - so we decided to add another. Our cache is hidden at a spot with nice long &#160;views and a bit of interesting history nearby. The road itself and the rock walls here were built by convict labour between 1929 and 1936. And as the name would suggest, the lighthouse can be seen from here.&lt;br /&gt; The cache is a 400ml camoed systema. There is no need to leave the road to&#160;reach the cache, nor to damage any plants to retrieve it. A spoiler photo is available to make the find easy.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">So did we. We had never cached north of Auckland international airport so there were a zillion caches to choose from while we were in Auckland for the Mega. We chose to do the Mega group walk on Rangitoto. It was a perfect day weatherwise, the group were great to stroll with and chat to and of course there were a few caches to find as well. Despite tired legs and feet we thoroughly enjoyed the day and our thanks to the cache placers and our guides for the experience. [:D]</groundspeak:text>

We have had so much fun over the past fifteen months, visited so many places and made many new friends along the way both in New Zealand and overseas. There are so many aspects of caching that we enjoy, night time FTF gatherings, events, physical and mental challenges, following our TBs on their travels, and trying to explain to muggle friends and family what exactly it is that we do that now takes up all of our time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/a818c175-9a46-4000-802b-66a830fe48c2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rangitoto Lighthouse sits in a prominent position on a reef off the coast in MacKenzie Bay at the side of Rangitoto Island in Auckland's Hauraki Gulf.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was built in 1882, but it was not actually lit until 1905. Although not classed officially as a lighthouse by the NZ MSA it is very well known to the Auckland boating community.&lt;br /&gt; The lighthouse is red and white in colour, standing 21 meters tall and currently operates on solar power, flashing red every 12 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;WP1 is a small container hidden in a rocky hole and when you locate this it will guide you to the final which when placed contained a log book, pen and the usual swaps.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Despite the terrain and our senior years taking their toll on our bodies we were up for the challenge. (just) It was pleasing to see that some of the others in the group were as tired as we were at the end of the day. Great company, great scenery and a most enjoyable day. Day one of the MEGA with the Rangitoto group walk. Thanks to Phasevisitor and Jacksonz for being our guides. Enjoyed the theme here. Nice view of the tall ships approaching Auckland.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">I'm visiting from Melbourne for the New Zealand Mega which means finding lots of caches and coming here especially to find this one [:)] - the whole experience has been fantastic. The weather has also been much nicer than back in Melbourne and that has meant long hours starting early and caching late into the night and not getting much sleep in between. I had spent many hours in the lead up to my arrival in New Zealand preparing an itinerary of caches, solved puzzles and places I wanted to visit and I'm pleased to say I completed just about everything I had planned. For the places I didn't get to visit, well that just means I'm gonna come back. I've seen stunning sights, walked lots of kilometres (and driven even more) met some great people and made new friends which has been awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks tofska for bringing me here and for adding to my positive experience.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">We had never cached north of Auckland international airport so there were a zillion caches to choose from while we were in Auckland for the Mega. We chose to do the Mega group walk on Rangitoto. It was a perfect day weatherwise, the group were great to stroll with and chat to and of course there were a few caches to find as well. Despite tired legs and feet we thoroughly enjoyed the day and our thanks to the cache placers and our guides for the experience.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">When we decided to come to the mega the trip to Rangitoto was the first priority on our list. It didn't disappoint. Despite the terrain and our senior years taking their toll on our bodies we were up for the challenge. (just) It was pleasing to see that some of the others in the group were as tired as we were at the end of the day. Great company, great scenery and a most enjoyable day. Day one of the MEGA with the Rangitoto group walk. Thanks to Phasevisitor and Jacksonz for being our guides.</groundspeak:text>

Luckily the speakers were up so loud that I had plenty of warning to get back on the track and look &quot;innocent&quot;. After the tractor passed with its load of muggles, I was soon back in there looking. This was a lesson in &quot;Trust thy GPSr&quot;, as where I thought the cache should have been was not the case. The GPSr was right all along. Another argument I have lost to it. The spot was awesome and the name of the cache made all that much more sense when I was in the right spot! TFTC!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">The second DNF of the day, and a rather disappointing lack of cache for me. Getting there was a mission in itself, so missing out on finding this one was a bit of anti-climax. However, the views from the shore were very cool and made the trip worth it. I will have to make a return to see if I can get this one in the future! Thanks heaps for the spot, which was really awesome.</groundspeak:text>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/46c73346-75f6-4691-8db9-53611e80236c.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Rangitoto has several nesting sites of black-backed gulls. The colony at Flax point is the youngest, and now one of the biggest. In 1964 there were less than 50 nests, but only five years later there were over 500. Now thousands of black-back gulls build their nests across the broken scoria fields on the low coastal flats. Nests are commonly situated on higher parts of lava mounds where gulls can easily take off and land. Nest density on such mounds is often extremely high with many nests in a group situated less than one metre apart. Eggs are hatched in December and January. &lt;br /&gt; Associated with the development of a gull colony is the prolific growth of encrusting lichens. It is thought that the lichen in these areas, together with the nest material brought in by the gulls, and the enriching effect of the gulls' excrement, have been key factors in the initial development of the island's vegetation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The gull colony is about a 1.5 km walk from the Rangitoto wharf on a well-maintained track. The track keeps far enough from the birds to avoid any disturbance. We suggest taking binoculars if you want a closer view of the birds. &lt;br /&gt; The cache is a 2 litre Sistema container covered with black tape. It is hidden about 5 metres off the track, on a small mound covered with vegetation. Tread carefully on these last few metres, as the scoria may be loose underfoot.</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;[No bikes, no dogs, kid friendly, restrooms available, takes less than 1 hour]&lt;br /&gt;The historic baches of Rangitoto are a must see for any visitor to the island.</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The bach communities on Rangitoto Island were built in the 1920's and 30's and consisted of private holiday dwellings and boatsheds as well as communal facilities such as paths, swimming pool, community hall and tennis courts. Built by families, using the scarce resources of the Depression era, the buildings demonstrate the 'kiwi' do-it-yourself, jack-of-all-trades attitudes of the times. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result of a prohibition order on further buildings in 1937, the remnants of the communities reflect this specific time in Auckland's development and as a result they are part of local history involving typical New Zealanders in a unique environment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because other bach communities, which were prevalent throughout the country, have virtually disappeared, the Rangitoto bach settlements are irreplaceable artefacts of New Zealand's architectural, and social history and therefore are important beyond their locality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A humble kiwi bach on Rangitoto Island made the big league by winning an international award for heritage conservation &#x2013; a first for New Zealand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rangitoto.org/pages/unesco.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;visit link&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rangitoto Island Historic Conservation Trust was formed in 1997 to retain, restore and interpret the baches left on the island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a short walk from the wharf around the coastline to see many of these baches.</groundspeak:long_description>

It was very special, more lovely and smaller like than the one I visited in Prague in the Czech Republic (Europe) this year. We met a lot of very kind and friendly people and really enjoyed the time over there. I took about 54 TBs and Geocoins heading to Europe with me, that's kind off crazy, I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we needed to move on soon, otherwise the Mega would have been ended before we arrived over there [:I].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2 stars at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gcvote.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GCVote&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;additional information: I will change my geocaching alias name from 'Schlitz13' to 'Megalodon'</groundspeak:text>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A new sculpture that has been built at the Albany Park and Ride is being confused for a chimney. The seven metre-high limestone sculpture, called LUNA, was commissioned by Auckland Transport and was erected in a new extension of the park and ride. Artist Caroline Robinson was commissioned to create the piece which was intended to ''communicate within the Oteha Valley, relating a quietness and steadiness, in dialogue with the earth, the water, the tall trees of the forest as well as the surrounding buildings and structures&quot;. &lt;p&gt;We would be interested in reading your comments on what you think of this piece of art? We think it looks like a tagine&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Due to the CCTV camera in close vicinity the cache has been positioned out of view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/eyeonauckland/7572141832/?q=albany%20park%20and%20ride%20sculpture&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

There were people on the play equpment near where we parked, but not near GZ, so a quick find and replace was possible. Thanks.</groundspeak:text>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is located above the local 100 Year Flood Plan and is relatively easy to find. It is a 200ml Camo canister containing logbook,pencil, pair of gloves, bouncy ball and fish. Whilst the cache is quite exposed I suspect it will be overlooked by most of the local muggle population. There is no need to leave the footpath although care should be taken with small children as a busy intersection is nearby Co-Ords ammended 27 Jan 2011 as per log this date</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">After walking the Okura to Stillwater walkway (and back) I had more time on my hand to find a few more caches in the area. The caches in this reserve were the last few I did today. I was pretty tired by now but had just enough energy for the ups and downs involved here. This one took a wee while to spot. Clever hide.

The caches in this reserve were the last few I did today. I was pretty tired by now but had just enough energy for the ups and downs involved here. A good sized cache nicely hidden.

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The NZ Kauri tree can grow to 50m in height and 16m in girth.&#160; They can live for 2000 years.&#160; In the past they were a common sight in New Zealand but the populatiopn of Kauri was decimated with the arrival of Europeans in the 17-1800s.&#160; The wood and gum were highly valued.&#160; The land they were on was cleared for farmland. These beautiful native trees are protected under the Department of Conservation and those on private land are also largely protected.&#160; Unfortunately the trees are being threatened again, this time by Kauri dieback, a fungus-like plant pathogen that affects only Kauri.&#160; It causes the yellowing of foliage, loss of leaves, canopy thinning and dead branches. Affected trees can also develop lesions that bleed resin, extending to the major roots and sometimes girdling the trunk as a &#8216;collar rot'. Kauri dieback can kill trees and seedlings of all ages.&#160; It is thought to be soil-borne.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Kauri trees in this reserve need protection from Kauri dieback.&#160; Please enjoy the beautiful walks through the native forest, but make sure you use the station before entering, to clean off your shoes and remove any traces of dieback that you may otherwise bring in.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Cache is a camouflaged nappisan container.&#160; You should be able to reach it by taking one step off the path.&#160; On placement it had a variety of items for swapping.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You can park at the side of the road at this entrance to the reserve, which I have allowed for in the ratings (only room for one vehicle) or at the other end&#160; in the carpark, but this will entail a fair walk.</groundspeak:long_description>

What a nice spot, but definitely steep in some parts! We walked the road back to the car, which was quicker. :) A quick find, TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

Lots of cutty grass here, and searching in all the wrong areas and getting sliced and diced before the cache was eventually found! Determination certainly paid off.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">Well it sure has turned dark now for my evening of caching. Luckily I had packed a torch as I couldn't resist making the climb up to this cache. I didn't get a chance to find the predecessor as the WP was missing the day I found the nearby earth cache. When I got to GZ I zigged when I should of zagged and spent I few minutes inspecting the wrong spots. Soon back tracked my steps and spotted the cool caching container. Now to find the clearing and check out the night time views. Took a different track out so I could collect a certain ammo can on the way back to the car. Nearly slipped over a couple times on the dew covered grass. Cheers for the night time adventure!</groundspeak:text>

If you want, take a photo (of the view) and upload it for others to enjoy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 15 years ago this cache would of been &quot;out in the sticks&quot;. But not now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The cache is a 400ml camo &quot;snap lock&quot; container &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Normal selection of goodies in the cache. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On the way down, you can just follow the path back down.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">What a journey! I did not go the sensible route and ended making my way over fences, streams and hills to get my way to the cache. Once I get there had to be stealthy as there were cars passing either side of me and once I get to the cache I had to find a tool to get the thing as my arms were too short. Makes for a memorable caching moment.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="True">Headed over here after dinner to grab this cache and check out the ugly structure on the bridge and to try and discern what purpose it served...... We can see it from Vaughan park Retreat Centre where I've been this week, so it has aroused our curiosity! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searched back and forth, couldn't get a fix with the GPS. Ended up locating a cache quite different from the container described about 11m from GZ. Signed the log and then headed back on our way after we watched a bunch of muggles race down the hill on a ride on mower they had converted into a trolley! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On our way across the road my mate from work and I discovered the actual cache container as described on the cache page. It was in the gutter by the bridge, contents in tact. Put it back where we figured it came from.</groundspeak:text>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">After a full on MEGA weekend many cachers from far and wide attended the &lt;b&gt;A Mega Sunet and BBQ&lt;/b&gt; event (GC4PG1E) to celebrate the fantastic mega activities that took place over the past several days. During the chit chat that was happening around the BBQ a comment was heard that there was space for a cache close by &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_big.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; /&gt;. With that knowledge a plan was hatched and with contacts in high places, this new cache was placed, reviewed and published in record time. What an awesome site to see such a large number of cachers sprinting across the grass for a large FTF gathering. Enjoy the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seventh cache in the Rangiora to Oxford Line series. You are looking for an Eclipse container. This is where the Eyreton branch joined onto the line.</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On a Geocaching trip around South Canterbury and North Otago in January 2012 we did a series of geocaches by erninz, based on the now-extinct Kurow to Oamaru Railway. Inspired by this great series we decided that this year we would put up a similar series based on the old Rangiora to Oxford Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was part of the Canterbury Interior Main Line, proposed in the 1870&#x2019;s, that was to link many of the branch lines in the Canterbury region. Specifically these were the Oxford, Eyreton, Midland, Whitecliffs, Methven and Mount Somers branch lines. Although the idea never came to full fruition this most northerly part was constructed and operated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rangiora to Oxford portion was opened on 21 June 1875 and closed on 19 April 1959. The Oxford to Sheffield portion was opened on 28 July 1884 and closed on 14 July 1930.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rangiora-Oxford line provided a link between the Main North Line at Rangiora and the Midland Line at Sheffield, passing over the Waimakariri River at a purpose-built rail/road bridge (now the Waimakariri Gorge Road Bridge). The main purpose of the line was to support the growing timber industry in the Oxford area. Oxford and Little River at that time had the two most significant stands of timber in Canterbury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the opening of the Rangiora-Oxford line the train travelled from the Rangiora Station to the Oxford West Station for the celebrations. Unfortunately all the dignitaries were assembled at the Oxford East Station and watched the train go straight past! However, the error was communicated to the driver and the train soon returned to the correct station.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The line operated two mixed trains (passengers and freight) each way daily. An evening train also travelled to Oxford from the Eyreton branch line. This line had stations at such places as Kaiapoi, Mandeville, Swannanoa, Horrelville and West Eyreton. But that is another story (and possible series). The Last Train to Clarkeville immediately comes to mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stations along the whole Rangiora Oxford Line were, in order, Rangiora, Bells, Fernside, Stoke, Springbank (Moeraki), Cust, Bennetts Junction (where the Eyreton branch joined it), Carleton, Oxford East, Oxford West, View Hill, Bexley and Sheffield (Malvern). The length of the line, from Rangiora to Oxford West, was 35.47 km and it was a single track, 1.0677mm (3ft 6in) gauge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further information on the Rangiora-Oxford Line is available from Beyond the Waimakariri by D N Hawkins, Exploring New Zealand&#x2019;s Ghost Railways by Leitch and Scott or online by googling Rangiora-Oxford Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are still many points along the adjacent Rangiora-Cust-Oxford road where you can see evidence of the old line &#x2013; signs, culverts, embankments, reserves and goods sheds. We have attempted to place a cache at or near every station between Rangiora and the Waimakariri Gorge. There are twelve caches altogether &#x2013; all park and grab. In some cases they are not at the exact spot for various reasons, which will be explained on a cache by cache basis. The alternative sites are in the area and at a relevant/interesting spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each chosen site has an Eclipse tin containing a log sheet, geocaching notice, silica crystal sachet, two pencils and a pencil sharpener. At the top of the log sheet is the name and number of a character from Thomas the Tank Engine books. Remember to read and record that information carefully for a future puzzle cache. (Beside the Line) Please be aware of muggles and return the container to its original position.</groundspeak:long_description>

Inspired by this great series we decided that this year we would put up a similar series based on the old Rangiora to Oxford Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was part of the Canterbury Interior Main Line, proposed in the 1870&#x2019;s, that was to link many of the branch lines in the Canterbury region. Specifically these were the Oxford, Eyreton, Midland, Whitecliffs, Methven and Mount Somers branch lines. Although the idea never came to full fruition this most northerly part was constructed and operated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rangiora to Oxford portion was opened on 21 June 1875 and closed on 19 April 1959. The Oxford to Sheffield portion was opened on 28 July 1884 and closed on 14 July 1930.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rangiora-Oxford line provided a link between the Main North Line at Rangiora and the Midland Line at Sheffield, passing over the Waimakariri River at a purpose-built rail/road bridge (now the Waimakariri Gorge Road Bridge). The main purpose of the line was to support the growing timber industry in the Oxford area. Oxford and Little River at that time had the two most significant stands of timber in Canterbury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the opening of the Rangiora-Oxford line the train travelled from the Rangiora Station to the Oxford West Station for the celebrations. Unfortunately all the dignitaries were assembled at the Oxford East Station and watched the train go straight past! However, the error was communicated to the driver and the train soon returned to the correct station.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The line operated two mixed trains (passengers and freight) each way daily. An evening train also travelled to Oxford from the Eyreton branch line. This line had stations at such places as Kaiapoi, Mandeville, Swannanoa, Horrelville and West Eyreton. But that is another story (and possible series). The Last Train to Clarkeville immediately comes to mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stations along the whole Rangiora Oxford Line were, in order, Rangiora, Bells, Fernside, Stoke, Springbank (Moeraki), Cust, Bennetts Junction (where the Eyreton branch joined it), Carleton, Oxford East, Oxford West, View Hill, Bexley and Sheffield (Malvern). The length of the line, from Rangiora to Oxford West, was 35.47 km and it was a single track, 1.0677mm (3ft 6in) gauge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further information on the Rangiora-Oxford Line is available from Beyond the Waimakariri by D N Hawkins, Exploring New Zealand&#x2019;s Ghost Railways by Leitch and Scott or online by googling Rangiora-Oxford Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are still many points along the adjacent Rangiora-Cust-Oxford road where you can see evidence of the old line &#x2013; signs, culverts, embankments, reserves and goods sheds. We have attempted to place a cache at or near every station between Rangiora and the Waimakariri Gorge. There are twelve caches altogether &#x2013; all park and grab. In some cases they are not at the exact spot for various reasons, which will be explained on a cache by cache basis. The alternative sites are in the area and at a relevant/interesting spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each chosen site has an Eclipse tin containing a log sheet, geocaching notice, silica crystal sachet, two pencils and a pencil sharpener. At the top of the log sheet is the name and number of a character from Thomas the Tank Engine books. Remember to read and record that information carefully for a future puzzle cache. (Beside the Line) Please be aware of muggles and return the container to its original position.</groundspeak:long_description>

The length of the line, from Rangiora to Oxford West, was 35.47 km and it was a single track, 1.0677mm (3ft 6in) gauge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further information on the Rangiora-Oxford Line is available from Beyond the Waimakariri by D N Hawkins, Exploring New Zealand&#x2019;s Ghost Railways by Leitch and Scott or online by googling Rangiora-Oxford Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are still many points along the adjacent Rangiora-Cust-Oxford road where you can see evidence of the old line &#x2013; signs, culverts, embankments, reserves and goods sheds. We have attempted to place a cache at or near every station between Rangiora and the Waimakariri Gorge. There are twelve caches altogether &#x2013; all park and grab. In some cases they are not at the exact spot for various reasons, which will be explained on a cache by cache basis. The alternative sites are in the area and at a relevant/interesting spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each chosen site has an Eclipse tin containing a log sheet, geocaching notice, silica crystal sachet, two pencils and a pencil sharpener. At the top of the log sheet is the name and number of a character from Thomas the Tank Engine books. Remember to read and record that information carefully for a future puzzle cache. (Beside the Line) Please be aware of muggles and return the container to its original position.</groundspeak:long_description>

A number of other lollies also use this flavouring, eg the black jelly bean. In our younger years no lolly mixture was ever complete without one of these delicious wheels.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Congratulations TeamKIMONNO on your 1500th find &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Turkey mom had quite a number of young with her. By the time I went for the camera they had disappeared as no food from us today. Actually not sure what you would feed a turkey and I definitely didn't have any chicken food.</groundspeak:text>

A nearby stick proved invaluable to retrieve this as it wasn't even in the right place. Has now been returned to where it shoud be and fresh cover placed over it. Remember caches are made by others just like you and would you like your caches to be mishandled and broken.</groundspeak:text>

We think we've put out a good selection of favourites and are sure you'll find something you like in M&amp;M's lolly scramble.&lt;br /&gt; So&#8230; grab your GPSr, friends &lt;b&gt;and a pen&lt;/b&gt;, and come and get your share!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Jaffas:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Who can resist these orange-coated chocolate balls? The movies wouldn't be the same without them, and it seems that's been the case for years. As a teen my mother sat in the balcony of the theatre and took great delight in dropping them over the railing on the people below! They roll so well on wooden floors too.&lt;br /&gt; All kiwis also enjoy the yearly great Jaffa race that happens down New Zealand's steepest street (in Dunedin). Just how do they manage to get those numbers on the jaffas? It sure is awesome to watch.</groundspeak:long_description>

We think we've put out a good selection of favourites and are sure you'll find something you like in M&amp;M's lolly scramble.&lt;br /&gt; So&#8230; grab your GPSr, friends &lt;b&gt;and a pen&lt;/b&gt;, and come and get your share!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Licorice Allsorts:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Liquorice Allsorts (also spelled licorice Allsorts) consist of a variety of liquorice sold as a mixture. These lollies are made of liquorice, sugar, coconut, aniseed jelly, fruit flavourings, and gelatine. Who doesn't like peeling their licorice apart, layer by layer; extending our enjoyment of eating of one of these delicious lollies.</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eighth cache in the Rangiora to Oxford Line series. You are looking for an Eclipse container.</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On a Geocaching trip around South Canterbury and North Otago in January 2012 we did a series of geocaches by erninz, based on the now-extinct Kurow to Oamaru Railway. Inspired by this great series we decided that this year we would put up a similar series based on the old Rangiora to Oxford Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was part of the Canterbury Interior Main Line, proposed in the 1870&#x2019;s, that was to link many of the branch lines in the Canterbury region. Specifically these were the Oxford, Eyreton, Midland, Whitecliffs, Methven and Mount Somers branch lines. Although the idea never came to full fruition this most northerly part was constructed and operated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rangiora to Oxford portion was opened on 21 June 1875 and closed on 19 April 1959. The Oxford to Sheffield portion was opened on 28 July 1884 and closed on 14 July 1930.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rangiora-Oxford line provided a link between the Main North Line at Rangiora and the Midland Line at Sheffield, passing over the Waimakariri River at a purpose-built rail/road bridge (now the Waimakariri Gorge Road Bridge). The main purpose of the line was to support the growing timber industry in the Oxford area. Oxford and Little River at that time had the two most significant stands of timber in Canterbury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the opening of the Rangiora-Oxford line the train travelled from the Rangiora Station to the Oxford West Station for the celebrations. Unfortunately all the dignitaries were assembled at the Oxford East Station and watched the train go straight past! However, the error was communicated to the driver and the train soon returned to the correct station.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The line operated two mixed trains (passengers and freight) each way daily. An evening train also travelled to Oxford from the Eyreton branch line. This line had stations at such places as Kaiapoi, Mandeville, Swannanoa, Horrelville and West Eyreton. But that is another story (and possible series). The Last Train to Clarkeville immediately comes to mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stations along the whole Rangiora Oxford Line were, in order, Rangiora, Bells, Fernside, Stoke, Springbank (Moeraki), Cust, Bennetts Junction (where the Eyreton branch joined it), Carleton, Oxford East, Oxford West, View Hill, Bexley and Sheffield (Malvern). The length of the line, from Rangiora to Oxford West, was 35.47 km and it was a single track, 1.0677mm (3ft 6in) gauge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further information on the Rangiora-Oxford Line is available from Beyond the Waimakariri by D N Hawkins, Exploring New Zealand&#x2019;s Ghost Railways by Leitch and Scott or online by googling Rangiora-Oxford Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are still many points along the adjacent Rangiora-Cust-Oxford road where you can see evidence of the old line &#x2013; signs, culverts, embankments, reserves and goods sheds. We have attempted to place a cache at or near every station between Rangiora and the Waimakariri Gorge. There are twelve caches altogether &#x2013; all park and grab. In some cases they are not at the exact spot for various reasons, which will be explained on a cache by cache basis. The alternative sites are in the area and at a relevant/interesting spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each chosen site has an Eclipse tin containing a log sheet, geocaching notice, silica crystal sachet, two pencils and a pencil sharpener. At the top of the log sheet is the name and number of a character from Thomas the Tank Engine books. Remember to read and record that information carefully for a future puzzle cache. (Beside the Line) Please be aware of muggles and return the container to its original position.</groundspeak:long_description>

  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is named in honour of the unusual foundations of nearby Fyffe House. Fyffe House (open to the public) was built for the cooper who made the barrels for the whale oil at the whaling station in the mid 1800&#x2019;s. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a safe sandy swimming beach just along the road which is popular with the locals for launching their boats and kayaks. Don&#x2019;t miss the seal colony at the end of the road and the magnificent views on the peninsula walkway which begins at the seal colony car park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coastal area running west from the cache to the new pier is currently closed to food gathering to allow the formerly rich fish and shellfish life to recover. The rahui (temporary closure) continues until September 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The views to the west, east, north and south must surely make Kaikoura one of the most beautiful locations in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is a 200ml camo painted container with limited room for swaps. When placed it contained a pencil, log book and some small swaps. Watch out for prickles as you reach for it.</groundspeak:long_description>

Takes me two hours. Doing this option, suggest park at South Bay picnic area (toilets,water), do Peninsular first.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, you can walk them individually, both entrances given on each cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dempseys Track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to have this by the 2nd seat up, but could not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If going to this from bottom start, an extra minute or so and you can enjoy views, and spot the handiwork of locals at play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need to leave the track for the cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{lease leave the cache well covered with leaf litter when you leave. thank you.</groundspeak:long_description>

Returning it was a little more troublesome, as a group of dog-walkers had stopped to have a chat right next to our car, in plain sight of GZ! However, we waited them out, and returned cache with no one being any the wiser! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cache was very visible when found, so have replaced it with some natural camo cover. The mini-BammJams chose a jandal keyring to take out of the cache, and put in a dice. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

The cache is named after our new son. He has been introduced to geocaching this weekend with the visit of his Grandparents.</groundspeak:short_description>
  <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We have placed this micro cache, as our son is just a little baby and have made just a little cache for him.&lt;br /&gt;The park is used by the local youth for skateboarding and also dog owners. It&#x2019;s the only park that is Dog friendly in the area. &lt;br /&gt;If you time your visit right you might even spot The Tranz Coastal or a freight train. Please, as always, keep an eye on the little ones, near the tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cache is a small magnetic key holder. It could fit small geocoins and has one for the FTF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Log Note, Silica(Please do not take or eat), BYO Pen.&lt;br /&gt;Some stealth will be needed muggles may be spying on you from up high or below you.</groundspeak:long_description>

A quick and easy find, there was a wee dolphin in the cache that the mini-BammJams wanted to take, but we couldn't fit our dice in to replace it, so the dolphin remains for another day.
